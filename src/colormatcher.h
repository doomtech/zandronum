// This class implements a "pretty good" color matcher for palettized images.
// In many cases, it is able to choose the "best" color with only a few
// comparisons. In all other cases, it chooses an "almost best" color in only
// a few comparisons. This is much faster than scanning the entire palette
// when you want to pick a color, so the somewhat lesser quality should be
// acceptable unless quality is the highest priority.
//
// The reason for the lesser quality is because this algorithm stores groups
// of colors into cells in a color cube and then spreads those color groups
// around into neighboring cells. When asked to pick a color, it looks in a
// single cell and sees which of the colors stored in that cell is closest
// to the requested color. For borderline cases, the chosen color may not
// actually be the best color in the entire palette, but it is still close.
//
// The accuracy of this class depends on the input palette and on HIBITS.
// HIBITS 4 seems to be a reasonable compromise between preprocessing time,
// space, and accuracy.
