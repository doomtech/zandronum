This is not the complete FLAC distribution. It contains only what
ZDoom needs to decode compressed FLAC streams. For the complete
distribution, please visit <http://flac.sourceforge.net/>. The
version here is currently version 1.2.1.

Of course, under Linux, you are encouraged to ignore this source
here and dynamically link to the full libraries.
