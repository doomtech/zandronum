v0.97d-beta5
------------

*+	- No more paper thin sprites: Added x/y axis billboard mode for sprite rendering, controlled by the new CVAR gl_billboard_mode (default 2). [Torr Samaho]
		gl_billboard_mode == 1 : y axis billboard (the way GZDoom renders sprites)
		gl_billboard_mode == 2 : x/y axis billboard (the mode countless of people have requested :D)
*-	- Crash logs should finally work on all Windows machines. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the dynamic light definitions for Heretic and Hexen from ZDoomGL. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added invasion spawners for Heretic! [Carnevil, Aabra, and Tun]
+	- Enhanced the IWAD selection box, allowing users to see their version, select their IWAD, and set video settings. It also looks nicer. [Rivecoder]
+	- Improved the revision display in the console. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added the r_drawspectatingstring CVAR, which can be used to hide that message for screenshots or movies. [Rivecoder]
+	- Skulltag can be build and run without FMOD now (with no sound of course). This makes it possible to build servers for systems that FMOD doesn't support, like FreeBSD. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CVar sv_markchatlines (default false). If set to true, all chat lines will be preceded by a string saying "CHAT " in the server console / logfile. This is to make the chat lines readily identifiable, necessary for MiX-MaN's IRC server control tool for example. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added Player.RunHealth property (ported the change from ZDoom revision 448). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Server console: you can now kick, ban, and IP check directly from the main scoreboard! [Rivecoder]
+	- Server console: when kicking or banning, reasons can now have spaces. [Rivecoder]
+	- Server console: added a statusbar - you can now see your IP, Public/Private/LAN status, current map, and version.
+	- Improved the display of the bottom string; 'x allies/opponent' display now reflects that of the player you're spying; added a few missing linebreaks. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added a GTK+ version of the IWAD selection box (ported the change from ZDoom revision 451). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Ported the updated startup screen code from GZDoom 1.0.24 to ST. This includes simulations of Heretic's and Hexen's startup screen. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Class selection screen is now shown when joining a multiplayer non Hexen, not team based game with more than one available player class. [Torr Samaho]
+	- sv_banfile can now be a path, so that banfiles can be placed anywhere. [Rivecoder]
+	- Ban reasons are read from the banfile now. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Revamped the way the ban list is handled internally, this allows an unlimited number of bans and fixes the problem that ST will remain in memory after closing it, if the ban list was too big. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added basic inventory drawing support to the Skulltag Doom HUD (doesn't respect scaling yet). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Revamped the way double defined actors are handled: If a definition of an already defined actor is encountered, "2" will be appended to the name and the new actor replaces to old one. This should give full compatibility with PWADs that use actors whose name conflict with Skulltag actors. [Torr Samaho]
+	- If a replaced weapon is added to a slot with setslot, the replacement weapon will also be added to the slot. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added MD2/DMD/MD3 model frame interpolation, controlled by the the new CVAR gl_interpolate_model_frames. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added model skin color translation support. The skin texture may only use colors from the game palette, otherwise it won't work properly. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Models respect the actor render style now, e.g. a model of a player with an invisibility sphere is rendered translucent. To reduce the problems caused by missing depth sorting, back face culling is used. This doesn't work if the model is not a closed surface. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added z-offset support to MODELDEF. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added Doomsday like rotation of the weapon pickup models, controlled by the the new CVAR gl_rotate_weapon_models. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added workaround for the missing pitch information of rockets to render the models of rockets fired with a vertical angle different from zero properly. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD getIP for server admins, which can be used to the IP address of a player. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added CCMD getIP_idx for server admins, uses indexes from playerinfo. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added CCMD ban_idx for server admins, to ban by index. [Rivecoder]
+	- When you run playerinfo from the server or RCON, player IPs are now displayed. [Rivecoder]
+	- The compact vote screen now obeys text scaling and displays nicely after voting. [Rivecoder]
+	- You can now see who voted for what on the scoreboard. [Rivecoder]
+	- On the scoreboard, multiple icons can be shown next to players (bot, talking, ready, handicap, vote).
+	- Crash logs can now be configured by the new CVAR crashlogs (default value 1): [Torr Samaho]
		crashlogs == 0 : crash logs are turned off (not recommended)
		crashlogs == 1 : the standard crash dialog is shown
		crashlogs == 2 : the crash report is automatically written to disk using an unused filename of type CrashReportXXX.zip in the directory controlled by the new CVAR crashlog_dir (very useful for server admins)
+	- Added different particle drawing options to the GL renderer, controlled by the new CVAR gl_particles_style (default 2). [Torr Samaho]
		gl_particles_style == 0 : square (the way GZDoom renders particles)
		gl_particles_style == 1 : round
		gl_particles_style == 2 : smooth
-	- Fixed a crash that would occur frequently in game modes in which the map experiences a map reset at some point (LMS, duel, survival, etc.). [Carnevil]
-	- Rank/spread/DM stats and team scores now show up in the ZDoom - and hence Heretic -  HUD. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: Ignoring definitions of already defined decorate actors which use ":" or "replace" didn't work. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Flags and skulltag skulls now work in any Doom engine-based game. [Carnevil]
-	- If you're spying someone and aren't allowed to view their stats, Skulltag now draws dashes on the original HUD. [Rivecoder]

-	- Players can now join a team from spectator mode when the "players cannot switch teams" dmflag is enabled. [Carnevil]
-	- Removed CVAR sv_stay97c3compatible, since beta4 broke network compatibility with 97c3 even with sv_stay97c3compatible set to true. [Torr Samaho]
-	- When respawn telefragged in LMS and survival games, you no longer instantly respawn when the "Allow instant respawn" compatflag is enabled. [Carnevil]

+	- Refined the code that hides health/armor in instagib. It now only hides it in deathmatch. (You could set the instagib flag and play coop, for example). [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed client-side crash that would occur when connecting to buckshot servers. [Carnevil]
-	- Fixed server-side error that would result in numerous overflow messages and strange behavior on the client end. [Carnevil]
-	- Fixed client-side crash that would occur when a sound played with the original sound curve compatflag enabled and the player's view was not active. [Carnevil]
-	- Fixed crash that would occur if the level time became too high (or in the case of clients, joining servers that have been up for more than two days without a map change). [Carnevil]

v0.97d-beta4
------------

*+	- Added Linux client and server support! [Torr Samaho]

-	- Changed: LAN broadcast now don't go anymore to 255.255.255.255 but instead to the broadcast address depending on the class of the network the server is in. This should improve the behavior under Windows and is essential under Linux, since the Linux kernel doesn't seem to permit broadcasts to 255.255.255.255. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Added CVAR sv_logfilenametimestamp (default true). If it's true, a timestamp will be appended to the name of the logfile generated by the CCMD logfile. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed: CCMD summonfriend doesn't work online (netcode for this was nonexistent). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The line special Thing_Damage (tid, amount, MOD) doesn't work in case of tid == 0. [Torr Samaho]

+	- Invasion: Your kill count is now shown in the top-right of the screen. [Rivecoder]
+	- Duel: Rank is now hidden. [Rivecoder]
+	- LMS: The line about how spectators can't talk to living players now shows next to the chat prompt, and shows for players too. [Rivecoder]
+	- Team Possession: Now shows who scored in online games. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added netcode to handle the use of inventory items online. This should fix the CCMDs "invuseall", "invuse" and "use" - dropping items is not yet supported. (Needs *heavy* testing - brand new code). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Pistol, shotgun and chaingun decals now work online. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the 'chatting' icon to the scoreboard. [Rivecoder]
+	- IDESE now supports pk3 files! [Bond]
-	- Fixed: BlueColumn emits red light, not blue. [Metalhead]
-	- The Reflection rune announcer is now played on pickup. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Converted Fist and Chainsaw to DECORATE. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed ACS functions ClearInventory/DoClearInv online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Players' extra data is now update when spying after joining (possible in coop, for example). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Deactivated chasecam cheat message, in any non deathmatch/teamgame game. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The Chainsaw's kickback was initialized to the default - not 0. (ported from ZDoom) [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Hirestex replacements for sprites didn't work properly (ported from GZDoom, kudos to Graf for fixing this in no time!) [Torr Samaho]
-	- server_GenericCheat only tells the client who toggled chasecam of the cheat, the others don't need to know about it. This fixes display problems, when spying someone who has chasecam on. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: jerky movement online in a WaterZone. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Game crashes directly in a cooperative skirmish, e.g. if you start with "+multiplayer +map map01". [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: player classes not working online. (Needs extensive testing) [Torr Samaho]
-	- Single player class selection menu now works in singleplayer. (Tested with Hexen and Ghouls vs Marines) [Torr Samaho]
-	- Class selection are respected in offline skirmish. [Torr Samaho]

-	- "addmap", "callvote map" and "callvote changemap" now work on maps contained in pk3s. Maplist now works as well. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the "Using unknown weapon type" bug, which happened in Ghouls vs Marines, if you are a Ghoul and fire your weapon after a map change. This should fix this bug once and for all (it occurred for Metal occasionally before) and could also fix the "player starts with fists" in coop bug. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: a Heretic client crashes if the server changes the map with the CCMD map. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: With switchonpickup == 1, some weapons are brought up powered up on pickup, even if the player doesn't have a PowerWeaponLevel2 active. Affects the mace in Heretic, for example. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Generalized the way key letters are handled, which are used for weapon changes to reduce network traffic. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Added the join game menu, which now shows in a team-less game instead of the y/n prompt. This way there can be the 'how to play' choice. [Rivecoder]
!	- In the oldstyle fullscreen HUD, keys are only shown in coop now. [Rivecoder]
!	- Reorganized the Display Options menu; added the HUD menu. [Rivecoder]

v0.97d-beta2
------------

+	- Skulltag now erases ZDoomGL settings (any renderer settings, really) the first time you run it on an old profile. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added spread support rune for your custom DECORATE weapons! [Torr Samaho]
+	- Upgraded the GZDoom renderer to 1.0.24! [Torr Samaho]
+	- Updated to Randy's new vector math routines. [Torr Samaho]
-	- This new vector code fixes a Software bleeding sector rendering bug.
-	- Fixed the 'change renderer' messages and fixed a typo. [Torr Samaho]
-	- When hosting a server, sound is automatically disabled. This fixes problems when running Skulltag on servers without sound cards. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a server crash with custom ambient sounds (and possibly other undiscovered crashes). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed transparent textures that blocked projectiles or monsters. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the TESTCOLOR grayscale bugs and crashes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- (Possibly) fixed the respawn invunerability palete bug. This needs testing. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the cooperative HUD armor display bug! [Torr Samaho]
-	- Dynamic lights with a duration of -1 work now. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the server maplist "FRAGS" bugs! This needs thorough testing. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Console command 'addmap' now will only add the map if it exists. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Console command 'changeteam' now gives an error when used in non-teamgame modes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a crash when the map was reset after the countdown. [Torr Samaho]
-	- The online hitscan decal fix has now been declared bug-free and officially included for the SSG. [Torr Samaho]
+	- You can toggle the hitscan decals with the CVAR cl_hitscandecalhack. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Increased the prescision of texture scaling from GZDoom. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Removed the old tx and ty CVARs, as they've been removed in ZDoom. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Reactivated 3DMidtex support and changed ML_3DMIDTEX from 0x4000 to 0x40000000 (same as GZDoom) to fix conflicts. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d-beta1
------------

*+	- ADDED GZDOOM RENDERING! Skulltag has switched renderers and we've dropped the slow and buggy ZDoomGL renderer. This entails fantastic support for ZDoom's features, blistering speed, and fewer bugs! [Torr Samaho!]
*+	- Added dynamic lighting for ALL items for the new renderer! These include Doom items and Skulltag ones. Torches now cast light, plasma shots let out an eeire glow, and the spheres pulse ominously. [Metalhead]
+	- Added name restrictions on all player names! Players can no longer create line breaks in the middle of their names, use invisible or strange characters, or use blank names! This should make vote kicking easier, and help stem name abuse. [Rivecoder]
+	- NEW minimal vote screen! A display option, the "Vote Now!" screen takes up a small area at the top of the screen, instead of the entire screen. This should make votes less painful. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added game-sensitive F1 help. What this does is changes the help screen to match whatever mode you're playing. If, for example, you are playing Possession, the help screen will show you how to play, etc. This can help new players learn the modes, as well as relieve experienced members from having to explain them. Ever had someone not know to score in Skulltag? "F1 DAMMIT!" [Rivecoder]
+	- Created a new mapinfo entry, "f1"! Mappers can create CUSTOM F1 screens that can explain their ACS mod or level! Each map can have its own screen. Hopefully this should become the standard place to explain your game mode. [Rivecoder]
+	- Voting can be fined tuned! Added these server cvars: sv_nokickvote, sv_nomapvote, sv_nochangemapvote, sv_nofraglimitvote, sv_notimelimitvote, _nowinlimitvote, sv_noduellimitvote and sv_nopointlimitvote. This way each vote type can be deactivated individually. [Torr Samaho]
+	- You can longer leave the map rotation with a vote. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Updated Skulltag's internals to use a hybrid of ZDoom 2.1.8 trunk and GZDoom 2.0.22 code. Not all of the new features (such as custom states) have been used yet. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added support for Terminator and Possession starts! TIDs 6000 and 6001, these allow mappers to choose where the Terminator ball and Hellstone spawn at the start of a level! If you don't use these starts, a deathmatch start will be used as normal. [Rivecoder]
+	- When a player leaves a server, in addition to his frags and wins, his playing time is saved. This means that if you reconnect, your time isn't reset. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added death frames for Ultimus! [Doomjedi]
-	- When you get the Doom or Guard sphere, your vision is properly rendered. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed Teleport to Map special online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a server crash when monsters left a level. [Torr Samaho]
-	- A player using a doom or guard sphere is rendered in the correct color for the other players. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Removed the 1 frame delay between when the BFG10K shot explodes and the damages is dealt. This fixes time freeze mode. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a crash where if you try to join a server, when having wads with the correct names, but which don't contain the map the server is running. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed bug where runes weren't stored when you saved the game. Wart 04 is playable now! [Rivecoder]
-	- Bots ignore additional events if their queue is full (since the queue fills easily in time freeze mode). This should fix the "Event queue size exceeded" bug. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Added a experimental hack to fix the decals of the super shotgun online. If this works properly, it will be used for all hitscan weapons. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the give cheats online. [Torr Samaho]
+	- When a team scores in possession, the name of the scorer is also shown. [Rivecoder]
!	- Reorganized the player setup and multiplayer menu. [Rivecoder]
!	- Some internal changes how Actors are spawned online. I hope this can be used in the future to reduce the problems some have joining a server hosting UTNT. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Skulltag does not include most of GZDoom's gl-only features for now, such as 3D floors and reflective flats, to prevent advantages over software users.
!	- 0.97d briefly used ZDoomGL 0.81, but it caused more bugs than it helped. Major props to Torr for his hours of work to get both renderers working.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One remark about texture filtering: Because of countless complains in the past that the GL mode in general (regardless if ZDoomGL or GZDoom) is just too blurry and not doomish at all we decided to set the default filtering values in such a way, that the filtering resembles the software mode as closely as possible. These are not the recommended values, but the default ones, so that hopefully software renderer fans won't get scared away by the new renderer seconds after starting it for the first time.
The recommended values are as follows:

If you want to keep the sharpness of software more, but still enjoy filtering benefits, we recommend the settings

texture filter mode = none (mipmapped)
anisotropic filter = 16x

If you don't mind loosing a bit of the sharpness and want to enjoy all OpenGL benefits (as I do), we recommend

texture filter mode = trilinear
anisotropic filter = 16x

Especially if you use the high res textures, the latter is the way to go. Depending on the speed of your graphics card you can lower the anisotropic filter to improve performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.97c
------

+	- In invasion, ammo spawners now never run dry in network games.

*+	- Added POSSESSION DEATHMATCH mode! In this mode, players gain points by possessing a demonic stone that spawns at a random spot when the level begins. Hold onto it for a certain period of time, and you win the round! ... oh yeah, and did I mention you can't use any weapons while in possession of the stone? :)
*+	- Added TEAM POSSESSION mode! This is just like possession DM, but it is played in teams.
*+	- Added SURVIVAL COOPERATIVE mode! In this new cooperative mode, players stay dead until one of his buddies ends the level, or all of his buddies die. This new mode is much more hardcore, and should be lots of fun! :D

*+	- Added a new powerup, called the "Guardsphere"! This new powerup causes you to take 1/4 of the damage you normally take.
*+	- Clients now have the ability to call a vote! Clients can now vote on whether or not to kick or ban a player, change the map, or change the limits (fraglimit, timelimit, etc.). Simply use the "callvote" console command, or use the "Call vote" command under the "Multiplayer" menu.
*+	- Added simple skulltag mode! You can now create a skulltag teamgame map by simply placing two skulls, team starts, and score pillars! NO SCRIPTING REQUIRED! More on how to set up the score pillars later (it's easy!).
*+	- Instead of being its own game mode, "instagib" is now a cvar that you can set to true or false and use with ANY OTHER GAME MODE! This means that you can how have instagib FFA matches, or instagib duels, or even instagib SKULLTAG!
*+	- Added the "buckshot" cvar! Similarly to instagib, when this is set to true, players start off with just the SSG, and no items spawn on the level, creating a SSG-only battle!
*+	- Made changes to almost all of the existing maps to improve their gameplay! Now, Skulltag's existing maps should be even better!
*+	- Completely rewrote the packet loss system! This fixes MANY of the glitches encountered during multiplayer play, such as ghosts, having a weapon but not being able to switch to it, etc.! This will also make existing games smoother!

+	- Improved the fullscreen HUD! Now it does a far better job of arranging things, and shows you what your max. health/armor is, and shows you if you're carrying the flag/skull in CTF/ST! If you wish, you can use the old fullscreen HUD by setting cl_stfullscreenhud to false.
+	- Added a new and improved medal display screen! Now, when you hit the "show medals" button, it shows you the number of medals you've earned in the current match in a much nicer fashion!
+	- Dramatically improved the display of various HUD elements in fullscreen (aka when the status bar doesn't display), such as the scores in CTF and ST!
+	- Added a way to configure the privliges of spectators during LMS games! Now, the server can set "lms_spectatorview" and "lms_spectatorchat" to true or false, to allow/disallow spectators to have the ability to view players or chat respectively while spectating during LMS games.

+	- "Victory!" is now awarded for winning a LMS match, and "Perfect!" is now awarded for winning a LMS without losing any health.
+	- Added the ability to use wildcards in server bans! Bans such as 38.38.*.* are now possible.
+	- Added a new cvar, sv_flagreturntime! This sets the amount of time flags/skulls will return in after dropped. The default value is 15.
+	- Added tall versions of the Doom and Doom 2 skies! Thanks, EarthQuake (aka Seismos)! :)
+	- The map now resets to its original state at the start of each duel, and round of LMS.

+	- Addded many, many new textures! Thanks, Nick Baker! :)
+	- You can now choose which powerups the random powerup item cycles through! For instance, you could have it only cycle between the doomsphere and guardsphere! More on this later.
+	- On the HUD during one flag CTF, players names now display entirely in their team's color, so you can tell which team possesses the white flag at a glance.
+	- When spectating through the eyes of another player, a message saying "FOLLOWING - <name of player>" is now displayed at the bottom of the screen.
+	- White flag pickup messages now indicate which team picked up the flag, instead of it merely saying "White flag taken!"
+	- Cameras now work in multiplayer games!
+	- Added death frames for the "Hissy Hogger" skin... eons after being relevant.
+	- Bots can no longer be added past the sv_maxclients limit in servers.
+	- Slightly improved the win sequence of normal deathmatch modes, and team games! Now, instead of exiting to intermission immediately, there's a slight pause where "<name of winner> WINS!" is displayed, similarly to duels and LMS.
+	- Added the "kickfromgame" command for server admins! Instead of kicking the player from the game, this simply removes them from the game by forcing them to spectate.
+	- Added a new "Auto-select" option that is now the default option when choosing a team in various team modes. This selects the most appropriate team for the player to join based on scores, number of players, etc. "Join random" now selects a purely random team.
+	- Added new decorative items: tall and small white torches, tall and small yellow torches, and tall and small red tech lamps!
+	- Made some minor cosmetic improvements to D2DM6 and D2DM7.
+	- Added a new cvar called sv_banfilereparsetime! This new cvar allows servers to periodically re-parse the banfile, with sv_banfilereparsetime being the time in seconds between parsings. This can be quite helpful when running multiple servers, since now if you ban someone, you don't have to manually add the ban on each server!
+	- Added a new cvar called r_maxparticles. This sets the maximum number of particles allowed on the screen. It default value is the same as the previous default value for max. particles, which is 4000. You can still load Skulltag with -numparticles to override this.
+	- Added unique sound lumps for grenades' launch and explosion. Now it's possible to make a new sound for rockets or grenades that do not affect one another.
+	- Increased the power of the prosperity rune! You can now pick up green armor past 100%, AND it raises both your max. health and max. armor to 250%!
+	- The sprites for the red armor have been completely redone, and greatly improved!
+	- The railgun color specified by your userinfo now applied to the inner railgun trail in teamgames (where the outer trail corresponds to your team color).

+	- Skulltag now displays the ZDoom version along with its version in the lower left corner of the console.
+	- Improved the shading on the shoulder pads of the Base II skin.
+	- Added cleaned up versions of FLAT22 and FLAT24 (the red and blue jump pad flats). These don't have stray red/blue pixels around the edge.

-	- Grenades no longer bounce off of "line_horizon" lines.

-	- You can no longer change teams continously in teamgames.
-	- Weapons now give you give you the correct amount of ammo in teamgames.
-	- Fixed several flats that were either duplicates, or had names of existing textures. As a result, some flats have either been deleted or renamed. I apologize since I know this will screw up some (hopefully not a lot) existing wads, but I would be more than happy to update the wads.
-	- Your armor points now properly update whenever you're damaged in network games.
-	- Fixed bug where in terminator mode, the player's body was not flagged as being solid, allowing you to run through other solid objects.
-	- When connecting to a server, players who are dead when you connect now appear dead.
-	- People carrying flags/skulls in CTF/ST no longer have the flag/skull appear next to their name on the scoreboard (there's no need; it displays nicely in the bottom-right corner).
-	- Fixed bug where if you spectated after grabbing a flag in CTF, the scoreboard would still show you as carrying the flag.
-	- When a player is killed while possessing the terminator orb, the terminator orb is now properly removed from his possession (no more dead players with terminator icons above their head).

-	- The "x frags left!" announcer events now play even if you're a spectator.
-	- Fixed the sprite alignments on the random powerup.

!	- Flag icons that display over someone's head when they carry a flag have been scaled down.
!	- You can now press the "fire" key to resapwn when you die, in addition to being able to press "use".

!	- The "duellimit" and "winlimit" cvars is no longer archived.
!	- The bots' chat files are now located within skulltag.pk3.
!	- Skulltag now defaults to being in a window, rather than fullscreen. That way, if people have issues with firewalls (such as ZoneAlarm), they can more easily deal with the problem, and not get hung up.
!	- blood_fade_scalar, which controls the blood fade brightness, now defaults to "0.5" (it used to be 1.0). Now, new players aren't blinded when they get hit by something.
!	- Changed the bots "Charon" and "Pluto"'s name to "Seenas" and "Synas" respectively (they also have their own skins!).
!	- In duel mode, a new duel now starts after intermission, instead of everyone being made a spectator.
!	- Skins based off monster sprites now have sprite names that are unique.
!	- cl_startasspectator now defaults to "false," so that new players have a chance to configure their settings without getting shot at.

!	- "Incredible!" medals are now awarded if you get another kill within two seconds of receiving an "Incredible!" medal. In previous versions, an "Excellent!" medal would be awarded in this situation.
!	- "Most Impressive!" medals are now awarded for every 2 consecutive hits you make with the railgun after receiving a "Most Impressive!" medal. In previous versions, an "Impressive!" medal would be awarded in this situation.

!	- "Precision!" medals are now awarded for every 5 consecutive hits you make after receiving a "Precision!" medal. In previous versions, an "Accuracy!" medal would be awarded in this situation.
!	- The player who "You've taken the lead!", "You've lost the lead", etc. announcer events refers to is now the display player, not the console player.
!	- Instead of randomly being able to get invulnerability with the random powerup, you now get the guardsphere instead.

v0.96f
------

*-	- FIXED THE INFINITE LOOP BUG! This means that not only do servers no longer lock up and eat all the CPU, but the "Abnormal number of movement commands" kick should not occur anymore as well (unless of course you're actually cheating!).
-	- Team scores that do not trigger the announcer are done appropriately in network games.
-	- Skins that are scaled now appear properly in the finale.

-	- Fixed problem where if the "map" or "changemap" commands were used with map rotation on, it wouldn't adjust the current position in the map rotation list properly.
!	- Skulltag now allows reuse of the LAN socket. This means that if you have two instances of Skulltag open, you can see LAN servers in the local server browser in both instances.

v0.96e
------

+	- Rewrote the "checksum" aspect of network games! It's now referred to as "level authentication". Now, level authentication is done prior to joining servers (so no more joining the game, and then immediately being kicked afterwards), and has a nicer error message.
*-	- Fixed the bug where clients would get kicked for "Abnormal level of movement commands detected!" if the CPU on the server machine was overloaded.
-	- Rewrote the ban system so that it no longer parses the ban file each time it checks to see if an IP is banned. This should eliminate the "Couldn't open banfile!" warning messages.

------

*+	- Upgraded the ZDoom version to 2.0.63a! That means that you can now create custom actors with the DECORATE lump! REJOICE!
*+	- Revamped the entire sector system in client/server games! Floors, plats, doors, etc. ought to sync up much better now. In addition, many new types of floors, plats, doors, etc. that didn't work before now do (such as perpetually moving floors).
+	- Made a number of small improvments to the "WAITING FOR PLAYERS" and "SPECTATING" displays.
+	- Added a new "Messages..." option in the menu of the server console! The window that comes up has options for timestampping, logging, and more! This is accessible through the "Settings" menu.
+	- Servers now minimize to the system tray! You can disable this if you'd like, by setting "sv_minimizetosystray" to "false".
+	- The server window caption now reflects sv_hostname, instead of always being "Skulltag v0.xxx Server". Now you should be able to distinguish between servers when alt+tabbing through them, and having them all pop up from the taskbar in Windows XP.
+	- Added new and improved Hectebus sprites! Thanks Agent Spork!
+	- Added the ability to configure which weapons you start with in LMS/TLMS! The weapons that you start with are now controlled by the variable "lmsallowedweapons", which can now be changed with the commands "lms_allowpistol false", "lms_allowshotgun true", etc.
+	- Added a nice new set of messages that display in the upper-portion of the screen whenever you frag someone, or are fragged in deathmatch games. Yet more stuff inspired by Quake 3! :) You can disable this in the "Display Options" menu if you wish to.
+	- Greatly improved the method of selecting maps when sv_randommaprotation is enabled! Now, maps are not repeated twice in a row, and there's much more randomization.
+	- Completed the "Server information" dialog box for servers.
+	- Added a new "Statistics" dialog box, selectable in the server menu! It shows you statistics for your server, such as the total data transferred, maximum number of players on the server at one time, etc.
+	- Updated the graphics on the SPREAD rune! It looks great now! Thanks, killingblair! :)
+	- Improved the team picking mechanism for whenever the server chooses a team for a player, and whenever a player selects to pick a random team.
+	- Improved the "Spectating" message that displays when you're spectating. Now, it displays more helpful messages, including your position in line, should be you be in line waiting to play!
+	- If everyone leaves a map when playing on a server, the map now restarts after 5 minutes.
+	- Bots can now use "$level_mapname" and "$level_levelname" in their chat strings to substiture the lump name of the map, and level name of the map respectively.

+	- Added a nice little display that shows the current weapon selected when cycling through weapons with the weapnext and weapprev commands. It can be disabled by setting "cl_showweapnameoncycle" to false.
+	- Rewrote a good portion of the scoreboard code. Players are now grouped together better (ex. all spectators are drawn next to each other, all dead players are drawn next to each other, etc.)
+	- Added a new "sv_disallowbots" option. When set to "true", this will prevent bot pathing nodes from being created, and also disallow bots from being used. This allows the memory usage of servers to go down drastically.
+	- The "Frags" column in the server console now changes to "Kills" in cooperative, and "Points" in teamgame modes.
+	- LMS matches can now end in a DRAW GAME! Now, if the last two players left standing die in the same frame, the match ends in a draw game, instead of the loser being whoever's death code was executed first!
+	- Updated the Skulltag parts of the TNT and Plutonia map info lumps to match the default Doom 2 parts. (ARE YOU HAPPY NOW LIN? :P)
+	- Added the ability for maps to disable to creation of bot nodes by specifying "nobotnodes" in the MAPINFO lump. This is to help large levels load faster. (Oh yeah, this also means bots won't work on those levels).

+	- Servers now ignore launcher queries from IPs that have been banned from the server.
+	- Hectebus fireballs now leave scorch marks.

-	- Fixed bug that allowed a sped up computer hack to cause players to move and shoot many times faster.

-	- The "consecutive deaths without a frag" counter is now reset at the beginning of each duel/LMS match. As a result, you can no longer receive "You Fail It" or YSINE medals after dying once, twice, or any amount lower than the required number of deaths for those medals.

-	- Fixed bug where players who joined servers in the middle of a game would sometimes appear in-game on the scoreboard, when they were actually spectators.

-	- Terrains that splash when you land on them (such as water) no longer create multiple splashes in multiplayer.
-	- Fixed D2DM7, so that you can no longer rocket jump "outside of the level".
-	- Then proper weapon now displays when spynexting your buddies when you are not a spectator.

-	- Made a fix so that it should now be impossible to be kicked for userinfo flooding while connecting to a server.

-	- The level end delay is now reset if you change maps using the "map" command.
-	- Platforms that aren't activated by a line now work properly.
-	- The appropriate bullet puff type is set before enemies fire the railgun. This fixes a bug where if the enemy fired the railgun after the BFG10K would shot, all bullet of blood puffs would be BFG10K explosions.
-	- "Timelimit hit." now displays on the client end when time expires in a multiplayer game.
-	- Hidden skins are no longer displayed when the "skins" console command is used.
-	- You can no longer join LMS games during the win sequence.
-	- Removed the "droprune" command (it didn't do anything).
-	- Spectators are no longer factored into deciding whether or not your lead state has changed in a deathmatch game (ie. You can't take the lead against a player who's spectating).

!	- If a player gets another frag within two seconds of receiving an "Incredible!" medal, he now receives another "Incredible!" medal, instead of an "Excellent!" medal.
!	- The "Server information" dialog box is now accessible under the "Server" menu, instead of the "File" menu.

+	- Added a new skin, "Slyor"! This skin is based on Klesk from Q3A, and is now used by the bot Slyor. Thanks RottKing!
+	- Added new abilities when defining a new episode in MAPINFO lumps. Now, you can specify whether or not an episode is a bot episode, and what graphic/text to display atop the botskill menu. More on this later.
+	- The saving of player's frags mechanism has been expanded and totally redone. In addition to storing frags, wins and points are saved now as well. Also, players frags, etc. are no longer saved when kicked from a server.
+	- Added placeholders for Daisy's death frames. Daisy no longer disappears upon dying.

+	- Added a "Currently showing <x> servers" display message in the internal server browser window.
+	- Made a fix to a section of the client code that should result in less slowdown.
+	- Bots can now have their chat strings in wads! Several new botscript functions have been added to support this: SayFromLump, SayFromChatLump, ChatSectionExistsInLump, and ChatSectionExistsInChatLump. You can also specify "chatlump" for each bot in BOTINFO.
+	- You can now continue to see what place you're in during LMS games on the scoreboard after you've been killed.
+	- Added a new warning message for whever you try to specify a script lump or chat lump for bots that exceeds 8 characters.
+	- The "invalid checksum" error now has a better error message for clients who get kicked because of it.
*-	- Fixed bug that crashed servers whenever HudMessage was used within scripts. This prevented the D2ST1-3 from being played in multiplayer games.

*-	- Fixed the major slowdown problem with the bots on D2DM2.
-	- User info sent when a player is connecting to a server is no longer counted towards userinfo spam kick mechanism. This means that players who don't connect to servers quickly are no longer kicked.

-	- Fixed problem where you could bounce grenades off some dead bodies in Last Man Standing.
-	- Fixed an exploit that allowed you to change visiblity to full brightness in single player, then connect to a server, retaining full visibility.

-	- Fixed problem where after an intermission during some sort of team-based skirmish, bots would constantly respawn.
-	- When creating no bots in BOTINFO lumps, if no chat frequency is specified, it defaults to 50 (percent). Before, the chat frequency was not initialized, and would often be some completely random. This is why custom bots would rarely (if ever) say their roaming strings, killed strings, etc.

-	- Servers now spawn clients with their proper handicap on their first spawn.

-	- Fixed strange display problem in the server console where two lines would display on one merged line.

-	- Fixed bug where bots would rapidly open and close doors.
-	- The "Kick player..." and "Kick/ban player..." menus now works properly on the server console.

------

*+	- Upgraded Skulltag to ZDoom version 2.0.53.

*+	- Made large optimizations to how sectors work over the network. They are now smoother and less laggy!
*+	- Applied "connection type" to ALL weapons. 56K users are simply told when a weapon is fired, and by who. DSL users are told that, and the actual XYZ, angle, and pitch of the shot, so they can recreate the shot on their end. Cable users get the information about each actual pellet or missile spawned by the weapon firing. The higher the connection type setting, the higher the precision, and the higher bandwidth used.

-	- Monster pain chance is now no longer factored into the client end.
-	- Fixed telefrag bug where you appeared to be dead on the client end, but were still alive.
-	- Normal player sounds are now played when cl_skins is false. Before, even though the player sprite was normal, the sounds associated with the skin would still play.

Now, if both the server and client have at least a cable connection, SSG pellets will appear in exactly the right place, as opposed to their position being generated on the client end.

!	- Slightly lowered the volume of the firing sound for the minigun.

v0.95f
------

-	- Fixed problems with "double vertical" and "double horiz and vert" detail modes, and all other reported crashes.
-	- Clients no longer play "blue leads, red flag taken," etc. messages when connecting to an active CTF/ST server.

-	- Having cl_identifytarget on no longer activates lines activated by shooting when your crosshair is over that line.
-	- Flags crushed by sectors are now returned.

!	- Color codes are now stripped out of the text in the server window.
!	- Changed spectator mode so that powerups are cleared once you enter spectator mode. (Before, if you had the doomsphere and would spectate, you appeared to still have the powerup (indefinitely).)
