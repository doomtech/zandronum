*+	- Added unlagged support for player positions (controlled by the new CVAR sv_nounlagged). Clients can deactivate unlagged for their own attacks by setting cl_unlagged to 0. [Spleen, Torr Samaho, Eruanna]
+	- Extended the chat substitution by $location, the name of the current player position as specified by SECTINFO. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended coop info to work in team games (only info about the team-mates is shown). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added kgsws' Weapon DropItem patch. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_limitnumvotes (default true) that allows to turn of the vote flooding protection. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The server-master challenge now includes the revision number of the server. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Rewrote the master ban list sending code. If necessary, the ban list now can be sent split over multiple packets. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Considerably improved client side crouch prediction. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_coop_damagefactor (default 1.0). If set to any positive value other than 1.0, it multiplies the damage dealt to players by monsters with this value. [TIHan, Spleen]

-	- Fixed: A_ReFire didn't work properly online for morphed players. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Dead spectators using chasecam don't lose it when being reborn and chasecam is not allowed for non-spectators. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player was named "<server>" or "* <server>", certain messages generated chat sounds while they shouldn't have. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The network traffic needed by Sector_SetRotation increased linearly with the number of sectors that have the given tag instead of being constant. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: With sv_logfiletimestamp == true, the timestamp appeared multiple times per line when calling playerinfo. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When the respawn invulnerability runs out, the player body becomes opaque instead of returning to its default alpha value. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The ACS command TakeInventory didn't work properly online if it was used to take a bigger inventory amount than the target actually had. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed a particular instance of a weapon desync that happened when a player picked up a weapon with compat_oldweaponswitch enabled in the server. [Spleen]
-	- Fixed: invuse could crash the client when called before the player has a body. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The demo_spectatefreely and demo_skiptonextmap commands could be used while a demo was not playing. [Spleen]
-	- Fixed: Obituaries on puffs didn't work online on the clients. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The client thought it was lagging when a player joined a game using the "join" command. [Torr Samaho, Spleen]
-	- Fixed: Grenades could explode twice. The fix also moves part of the hard coded grenade implementation to DECORATE. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed: Actors derived from actors that use A_Jump could cause clients to crash. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The console command "crouch" didn't have any effect online. Note: It sill doesn't behave exactly online as it does offline but it should work sufficiently well. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A client wrongly assumed that players who were dead while the client connected still had their default health. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player with a high ping killed a player with the last available shot of a missile weapon (e.g. BFG), the client locally switched back to that weapon after the obituary was displayed. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The console command "changemap" didn't have any effect when called during a survival countdown. Now the map change is done after the countdown ends. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed: Newly connecting clients were not informed about the chat and console status of the other players. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Clients wrongly exploded missiles on their own. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When entering a server, a client spawned a teleport fog at the position of each player already in the game. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed: Skulls are not spawned in the Skulltag gamemode if either buckshot or instagib is selected. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a team takes the lead in TDM the corresponding announcer sound is not played if this team already was leading before the teams got tied or the map was changed. The latter only happened when no other team took the lead at least once since the map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Starting an offline skirmish on a gamemode with teamgame == 1 with the "Server picks teams (ST/CTF)" flag enabled could cause the game to freeze. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Chat and team messages are printed as white in the console instead of the corresponding user selected message color. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed problems with the join command offline: If it was used while already in the game, the player was respwaned at a player start and left behind a dummy player at the old position. If it was used in a gamemode with teams while spectating, the player joined the game but wasn't put into a team. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player used the morphme cheat without argument in a game other than Heretic or Hexen, he lost his current weapon after morphing back. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Directly after using the disconnect command to manually disconnect from a server loading saved games didn't work. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed: The local client flood timers (e.g. for "changeteam") are not reset during error clean up. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The angle of a player is not set according to the spawn point after a 'nointermission' map change online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed problems with A_CustomMissile on CLIENTSIDEONLY actors that happened when the spawning was blocked. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a "changemap" map change two teleport fogs were spawned for each non-spectator player. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed: Bots could join in survival and survival invasion while the game was in progress. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a dead player turned into a spectator, the spectator body still had the CORPSE flag. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The ACS command UnMorphActor caused a crash when it was called with (tid == 0) and the world as activator. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When sv_noteamselect was true in a game mode without teams, every player (including spectators) was put on a team after a "changemap" map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When sv_noteamselect was true in a game mode with teams, players connecting as spectators were put on a team even though being a spectator. The same happened after a "changemap" map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player carrying a flag/skull/terminator sphere/hellstone gets a medal, the medal isn't displayed as floaty icon, but the floaty icon corresponding to the carried item fades out when the awarded medal would. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a crash problem of the Windows server related to dynamic lights. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The playback of improperly closed client side demos (a crash happening during the recording can cause demos to be improperly closed) was not properly stopped at the end of the demo. [Torr Samaho]
!	- When adding a ban for an address that is already banned or when updating the expiration time of an existing ban, the comment of the existing ban is now updated. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- When a monster that is a friend of a player kills something, the corresponding player is treated as source of the kill (code submission from kgsws). [Torr Samaho]
!	- The CVAR sv_enforcebans now only affects local bans, enforcement of master server bans is still controlled by the CVAR sv_enforcemasterbanlist. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- The ACS function PlayerInGame() now returns false for spectators. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed the 'Smooth mouse movement' menu option from smooth_mouse to m_filter. smooth_mouse doesn't have any effect in Skulltag, so it doesn't need a menu entry. [Torr Samaho]
!	- In TLMS all players in the winning team that are still alive at the end of the round get awarded a win. Furthermore, the wins are displayed in the scoreboard in TLMS like already done in LMS. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Fixed some crash problems with demo_spectatefreely. [Torr Samaho]

!	- When a player leaves the game, the FriendPlayer property of all monsters belonging to this player is cleared (based on a code submission from kgsws). [Torr Samaho]
!	- When called from a CLIENTSIDEONLY actor, A_CheckSight now only checks whether the consoleplayer sees the actor. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Weapon ammo is no longer displayed in coopinfo when sv_infiniteammo is enabled. [Spleen]
!	- The CVAR timelimit is now ignored again in invasion and survival as it was before 0.97d3. It never worked in invasion or survival anyway and was intended only for non-coop modes. [Torr Samaho]
!	- For technical reasons disabled saving while bots are in the game. Also disabled saving in multiplayer, the saved games couldn't be loaded anyway. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Removed the "Player team" option from the offline skirmish team bot setup menu. This didn't have any effect and the player is supposed to select the team from the in game join menu anyway. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Removed the "Botskill" option from the offline skirmish bot setup menus. This already can be configured in the main offline skirmish menu. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Re-enabled the "resurrect" command in single player. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Spectators don't spawn a teleport fog anymore when entering a map. Other clients didn't see this fog anyway when the spectator initially joined the server. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Using "spectate" while a client side demo is played now does the same as "demo_spectatefreely". [Torr Samaho]
!	- Decreased the default value of sv_maxpacketsize to 1024 (the default used in 98b and earlier versions), the higher value used in 98c caused "waiting for server" problems on some servers. [Torr Samaho]


98c
---

*+	- Skulltag now supports Intel based Macintoshes (mainly done by backporting ZDoom revisions 1571, 1581, 1607, 1736, 1779, 1780, 1786-1788, 1793, 1807, 1814, 2122). [Blzut3, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added basic outbound net traffic analysis code for the server. This code allows to find out which actor classes and which ACS scripts use how much net traffic and should greatly simply the identification of network bandwidth hogs in custom mods. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a verification system that allows the master server to verify that a server-master-challenge came from an existing server. Furthermore, servers now acknowledge the receipt of the ban list to account for packet loss. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_logfile_append (default false). If enabled, a logfile is started and there already is a file with the specified name, the new log is appended to the existing file. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added free spectate mode for client side demos, started with the new CCMD demo_spectatefreely. In this mode, you can move freely while the demo is played as if you were a spectator while the game was recorded. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new DECORATE actor flag SERVERSIDEONLY. The clients don't spawn such actors, only the server does. Therefore, spawning or manipulating these actors does not need network bandwidth. Only use it on actors that are always invisible and don't block the movement of players. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "don't identify target player", controlled by the new CVAR sv_noidentifytarget. If this is true, clients are enforced not to identify players, i.e. behave as if cl_identifytarget == 0. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "always apply lmsspectatorsettings", controlled by the new CVAR sv_applylmsspectatorsettings. If this is true, lms_spectatorchat will be respected in all game modes. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the invasion spawners for Strife made by GorpusMorpus. Also thanks to Archfile for cleaning the doomednums. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the launcher protocol to optionally report the values of the new flag CVARs dmflags3 and compatflags2. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMDs ignore_idx and unignore_idx to ignore/unignore players by index. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_randomcoopstarts (default false). If true, in cooperative game modes players are spawned at random player starts instead of the one designated for them. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Further extended the OpenGL wallhack protection to catch another update of the hack. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Added new dmflag "don't draw coop info", controlled by the new CVAR sv_nocoopinfo. If this is true, clients are enforced not to coop info, i.e. behave as if cl_drawcoopinfo == 0. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: G_SecretExitLevel causes a skill change to 0 due to a typo by VC in G_ChangeLevel parameter list [Eruanna]
-	- Fixed: sv_forcegldefaults 1 doesn't properly enforce the default GL lighting mode after a map change. [Eruanna, Torr Samaho]

-	- Fixed problems with player names containing incomplete color codes of type "\c[X". [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Malformed net packets could be used to disguise chat messages as normal console messages. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: In LMS/TLMS and coop with "sv_shotgunstart 1" client side demos, the consoleplayer's starting weapon is not properly recorded. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player suicided online with "skill 0", the clients thought the player had a health of 24388 instead of 0. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a spectator disconnected, the disconnect particle effect was created at its last known position. Now the effect is already created when a player turns into a spectator. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a server crash that could happen directly after a "map" map change when there were players in the game before the map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A client that disconnected before spawning as spectator could cause an active duel to be reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Exploding projectiles didn't properly enter their xdeath or crash state on the clients online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Spectators could bump non-teleport line specials offline. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a player turned into a spectator while crouching, the spectator kept the slow crouching speed. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Actors like LostSoul that deal damage by slamming could cause player health desyncs on the clients. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Unmorphing with the morphme cheat didn't work properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A morphed player using the slot command online could cause weapon desync issues. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When servers that enforce the master ban list received an updated ban list from the master, they didn't automatically kick newly banned players already in game. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The AC value in Hexen is not displayed properly anymore on a client after an inter-hub map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Non-bouncy missiles disappeared when hitting the sky. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed some player class selection problems in non-cooperative offline skirmishes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The Hexen invasion spawners still used ArtiInvulnerability instead of ArtiInvulnerability2. Thanks to Gez for submitting a patch for this. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When there are only two teams, the scoreboard only shows the score of the leading team instead of both scores. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_FireGoldWandPL1 and A_FireBlasterPL1 did not award accuracy / precision medals. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The ACS function ReplaceTextures didn't work properly online and its effects were not reverted during a map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If the packet with the client's map change authentication is lost, the client stayed on the old map locally. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When playing a client side demo with a "map" map change, the console could be flooded by "No body for player" errors and Skulltag could crash. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a non Windows binary crashed, the crash catcher always got stuck. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a non Windows binary can't find any IWAD, it just exits without any error message. [Torr Samaho]
-	- The crash catcher in non Windows binaries now hopefully works better with recent GDB versions. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Bots didn't use the default movebob value 0.25. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: LMS/TLMS rounds end prematurely when only one player / team survives the spawn telefragging after the map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Starting a standard coop offline skirmish when survival was active didn't work. Instead a new survival game was started. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Powerup HUD icons overlap the HUD corner score. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed parsing problems with floats when the language setting uses ',' instead of '.' as float seperator under Linux. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Using "+deathmatch 1" as command line argument didn't work with non Windows binaries. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Under some circumstances, the wrong obituaries were displayed online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a bot was removed from the game, it didn't execute its disconnect scripts. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit that could turn a client into some kind of ghost mode. Kudos to kgsws for finding and reporting this exploit. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When re-entering a hub map online with more players than there were when leaving that map, the server could crash. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Trying to use chasecam on a non-coop server with sv_chasecam true and sv_cheats false caused the player to be kicked. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: LMS crashed on startup when a weapon was replaced via DECORATE with a non-weapon inventory actor. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: CCMD useflechette doesn't work online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a map change online with respawn invulnerability turned on, clients keep the invulnerability mugshot even after the respawn invulnerability runs out. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Players of an enemy team couldn't be spied when watching a client side demo. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In game modes where players earn "wins", the server returned the number of kills instead the number of wins for each players when asked for SQF_PLAYERDATA. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a projectile with negative damage hit a player online, the clients were not informed about the health increase. [Torr Samaho]

*+	- Greatly improved the windows server dialog! [Rivecoder]

		- Things that are entirely new:
			- Added COMMAND HISTORY! Made a mistake entering a command? Want to retrieve a previously-entered command? Just hit the "..." button!
				- NOTE: The command box now acts like the in-game console: you no longer have to precede your commands with a "/" to send them. (This was confusing too many people.)
			- "File|Join server" lets you immediately play on your server!
			- Added a HELP menu! This provides information for newbies and veterans alike.

		- Things that are now much easier to use:
			- Completely redid the CONFIGURATION DIALOG! It is now MUCH more intuitively designed, and easier to use.
				- Settings are grouped into tabs!
				- Settings that don't apply to your current game mode are hidden, keeping the dialog nice and clean.
				- Added missing settings (for instance, modifiers and voting settings).
			- Rewrote the STATISTICS DIALOG! You can read everything much more easily.
			- In the CHANGE MAP and MAP ROTATION dialogs, there is now a a list of available maps to choose from! It even autocompletes for you.
			- The dialog itself! The console is bigger, you can now see what game mode the server's using, and it's just more intuitive overall.

		- Smaller things:			
			- You can click the status bar to quickly adjust who can see your server and copy its IP.
				- You can also click the labels at the top of the dialog, to quickly change the map or adjust settings.
			- When editing the MOTD, you now get a reference of all the color codes!
			- When you go to close the server, it will warn you if there are players connected.
			- There is now a button to view the logfile.			
			- You can now add bots by right-clicking the scoreboard.
				- This menu also now supports temporary bans, and copying IPs is also simpler.
			- You can now very easily tell if you're running a public version because the status bar will simply show the version as "98a", "98b", and so on. Only in testing builds are the SVN revisions shown.

		- Bug fixes:
			- Fixed: the scoreboard would flicker if a timelimit was set, but no players were present.
			- Removed several unneeded or defunct dialogs.
			- The scoreboard and player list have been updated to support newer Skulltag features (like the "award damage instead of kills" DMFlag).

*+	- Added support for Maxim Stepin's hq2x/3x/4x pixel upsampling algorithm, like Scale2x/3x/4x controlled by the CVAR gl_texture_hqresize. In compliance with the LGPL, the upsampling code itself resides in a dynamically linked library. [Torr Samaho]
		gl_texture_hqresize == 4 : hq2x algorithm
		gl_texture_hqresize == 5 : hq3x algorithm
		gl_texture_hqresize == 6 : hq4x algorithm
+	- Added an IWAD setup screen that is shown instead of the fatal error message when no IWAD is found. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added new CCMD printjoinqueue that allows the server to list the full join queue. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "only spawn sp actors in coop", controlled by the new CVAR sv_coop_spactorspawn, based on a code submission by TIHan. If this is true in a cooperative game mode, map actors are spawned as if the game was single player. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the effect of the MAPINFO flag "islobby": Maps with this flag now behave as if sv_noexit is false (except for A_BossDeath and A_BrainDie). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Backported A_WeaponReady from ZDoom revisions 1698, 1711, 1720, 1723, 1776, 1789. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Re-added support for 32 player starts for non Strife games. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new actor properties "visibletoteam" and "visibletoplayerclass". Only players that are in the team specified by "visibletoteam" can see this actor, it is invisible to all other teams. "visibletoplayerclass" is the counterpart for playerclass based visibility. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added flags ALIGNANGLE and ALIGNPITCH to MODELDEF. If both are set, the model always faces the camera. If only ALIGNANGLE is set, the model faces the camera in the x/y plane. Note: ALIGNPITCH is not supposed to be used without ALIGNANGLE. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added flag ROLLAGAINSTANGLE to MODELDEF, a special flag for flat, beam like models. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed several problems with D'Sparil (Sorcerer1/Sorcerer2) online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In lms/teamlms players didn't get weapons whose game property is "any". [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If an actor with MF_SKULLFLY slams into something online, it possibly stops moving on the clients and starts to teleport around (This affected the Minotaur). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a client was removed from the join queue after a map change without being allowed to join, the client was not informed about the removal. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The join queue was cleared in duel after a "changemap" map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Inventory items that insert themselves into the player's inventory are not restored after a map reset after being used by the player. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When traveling between maps in a hub online, two different actors possibly use the same network id. Among other things, this can cause clients to crash. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The weapdrop command doesn't work online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: CLIENTSIDE enter scripts are not executed after a "changemap" map change. The fix changes the timing of enter scripts: Instead of running them when the server finished loading the level, they are run when the client finished loading the level. This means though that there is a time gap between spawning a player and running the corresponding enter scripts. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If the server instructed the clients to start a CLIENTSIDE ACS script, each argument was transferred as byte instead of as long. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Dead spectators that automatically reenter the game after a "changemap" map change in survival don't trigger enter scripts. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The standing assault gun in Strife can only be picked up once (ported from ZDoom revision 1671). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The MAPINFO property skyrotate is not parsed properly if the MAPINFO lump uses the new format (ported from GZDoom revision 403). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The Windows server DMFlags dialog didn't read the compatflags2 value when opened. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Internally the mapinfo properties islobby and nobotnodes used the same value. Thus, when one of them was set, the other was automatically also set. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: SBARINFO draws things marked as COOPERATIVE also in game modes where the CVAR teamgame is true. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If all players have negative frags and there are spectators in the game, the number of frags remaining shown on the scoreboard is not properly calculated. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Skulltag can't be started with certain command line options, e.g. "+map d2inv1 +invasion 1". [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Sprites from a fullbright frame with a brightmap disabling fullbright did not Process dynamic lights touching them (ported from GZDoom revision 635). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: demo_skiptonextmap has problems when the demo contains map changes that were made with the map CCMD. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When using demo_skiptonextmap, some of the sounds that were supposed to be played during the skipped part of the demo were played while skipping. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: AxeBlood and Bloodsplatter didn't work online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: ACS translations of type "CreateTranslation(x, a:b=[red1,green1,blue1]:[red2,green2,blue2])" didn't work online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: ACS translations created by CreateTranslation that remap more than one range didn't properly work online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed server side crashes that can happen during a map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If stairs are being build while the map is reset, these stairs won't build properly anymore after the reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The console floating icon is possibly not removed when a saved game is loaded. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Map spawned RandomSpawner actors don't spawn anything after a map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: On maps with a team selection room, the server possibly crashed when a spectator tried to join a team directly with the team CCMD. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Sector damage didn't work inside 3D floors. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The code to check the maximal allowed effective skin sprite width/height still could cause to Skulltag to crash at startup. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_MLightningAttack didn't update the ammo amount displayed on the clients online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The server possibly crashed when a player is spawned and respawn invulnerability is on. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Changing the dmflags2 value could crash the server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Players were told that they can't pick up the flag, when trying to pick up a team's skull if there are no people on the corresponding team. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When traveling from one map to the next online players with the class "random" were spawned as a new random class, but with the inventory they had on the previous map, causing numerous problems. Now the players keep their class and inventory. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The secondary shots of Heretic's crossbow were not aimed according to the player's pitch. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player turns into a dead spectator his ready weapon is not cleared properly. If the dead spectator then turns into a true spectator, this causes the clients to think that the last weapon he used is still in his inventory. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Teleportation could mess up the client side player prediction. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Line_AlignCeiling and Line_AlignFloor were not working properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The code to check the maximal allowed effective skin sprite width/height didn't take into account high res sprite replacements. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit that allowed to manipulate the master ban list on a server using a forged UDP packet. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed problems with the flat alignment in the GL renderer (ported from GZDoom revisions 384+414). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Automatic returning of the white flag in one flag CTF didn't work. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed skin per surface MD3 model support. Note: The code for this has been there for ages, but it never worked. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed problems with the LAN broadcast under Vista and Windows 7. [Torr Samaho, Bond]
-	- Fixed sync problems online caused by A_GetHurt. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_MStaffTrack could crash. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed rendering problems when the MODELDEF flags ROTATING and PITCHFROMMOMENTUM were both used on the same model. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The model frame interpolation didn't work for frames with the bright flag. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The medal code could get stuck in an infinite loop. Special thanks to Cannonfodder for finding out how to trigger the freeze. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Improved the handling of random state jumps on player weapons online. This hopefully fixes some client side crashes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps couldn't find the COLORMAP lump if it was only available in the colormaps namespace. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Clients that can't enter a server because of a range ban were not told the ban reason or the ban expiration date. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The team scores in non CTF/ST games are not displayed properly in the new fullscreen HUD if text scaling is activated. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Clients could crash during a "nextmap" map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Loading a saved game could cause a crash (fixed by backporting the info.h changes from ZDoom revision 1824). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Mirrors caused severe performance drops and rendering artifacts in GL. Kudos to Spleen for dissecting the GZDoom SVN and finding out what was causing the mirror problems. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Newly connecting clients were not informed about the actual RenderStyle and Alpha of the actors in the map and used the default values instead. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The effects of A_FadeIn and A_FadeOut were not properly synchronized online. This could cause client side crashes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a critical security bug of the server that allowed external RCON connections even if the server didn't set a proper RCON password. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_FireCustomMissile didn't take into account the CLIENTSIDEONLY flag properly. [Torr Samaho]
!	- You can now have an unlimited number of maps in the map rotation (previously 64). [Rivecoder]
!	- Removed the unused sv_masteroverrideip. [Rivecoder]
!	- The bounce sound of Skulltag's grenade is not hard coded to the actor name "grenade" anymore, but is controlled by the new actor flag USESTBOUNCESOUND. This way actors derived from Skulltag's grenade should inherit the bounce sound, while new actors called grenade don't automatically get the bounce sound. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Clients can't set the CVAR gl_nearclip to anything but 5 anymore. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- Removed all custom code for RedArmor. It uses the DamageFactor feature from ZDoom revision 1661 now. [Torr Samaho]
!	- GrenadeLauncher doesn't use A_FireSTGrenade anymore. Instead, it uses A_FireCustomMissile with the pitch parameter from ZDoom revision 1685. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Clarified the error message that is shown when skulltag_data.pk3/skulltag.wad is not found. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Negative movebob values are not allowed anymore. [Torr Samaho]
!	- A_FadeOut does not delete player bodies that are still associated to a player anymore. Instead a warning is printed. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Duel Scoreboard displayed the incorrect number of duels remaining. [Vortex Cortex]
-	- Fixed: CCMD "nextsecret" doesn't show intermission and can not be used in online games. [Vortex Cortex]
-	- Fixed: CCMD "nextmap" did not handle "enDSeQ" when used on maps such as ExM8 and MAP30. [Vortex Cortex]


98a
---

*+	- Thoroughly updated Skulltag's ZDoom base to the latest ZDoom SVN repository revision (currently 1551)! [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Upgraded the GZDoom renderer to 1.1.04 (revision 127, maintenance fixes from up to revision 322)! [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added support for voodoo dolls online, controlled by the new CVARs sv_coopspawnvoodoodolls (default false), sv_coopunassignedvoodoodolls (default true) and sv_coopunassignedvoodoodollsfornplayers (default 32). One of the limitations currently is, that the clients know nothing about the dolls, only the server does. Because of this the dolls are invisible on the clients. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
*+	- Revamped the ping calculation code! [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
		- Freed the ping from the shackles of Doom's fixed ticrate, i.e. the ping is not forced to be a multiple of 28 anymore, but calculated precisely.
		- The displayed ping of the clients is now averaged over multiple measurements.
		- The ping of the clients is now measured every second instead of every three seconds.
*+	- Fixed many of the annoyances with the voting system. [Rivecoder]
		+	- Vote-kicking a player now bans his IP for 10 minutes. [Rivecoder]
		+	- Vote callers can now cancel the vote they called (i.e., in case they made a mistake) by voting "no". [Rivecoder]
		+	- Added some flooding protection: [Rivecoder]
				- Each player can only call one vote per 5 minutes. [Rivecoder]
				- Each player can only call one *type* of vote per 10 minutes (to prevent spamming of, for example, "fraglimit 30..fraglimit 31...flaglimit 29...etc"). Kickvotes are ignored (because new mongs come and go) as long as they passed. [Rivecoder]
				- If a specific vote fails, it can't be revoted for 10 minutes. (It failed; let it go). [Rivecoder]
		+	- Made the client's voting menu nicer and easier to use. [Rivecoder]
				- You can now votekick players by selecting them, instead of having to type in their names. [Rivecoder]
				- Sorted the types of votes into categories and cleared up the difference between map/changemap. [Rivecoder]
				- Fixed several bugs that cropped up when quotes were used in the input strings. [Rivecoder]
		+	- Added vote reasons. These are brief blurbs explaining why a vote was called. [Rivecoder]
		+	- Vote-kicking is now more resilient; the mong's IP will be tempbanned even if he ducks out of the server right before the vote passes. [Rivecoder]
		+	- The actions of each vote ("Player votes yes, etc") are now printed in the client's console. [Rivecoder]
		+	- When a player is votekicked, the reason ("Vote kick, 5 to 2") is now stated. [Rivecoder]
		+	- A helpful message is now given if a client's vote is denied ("This server has disabled voting", "that player does not exist", "kick votes are disabled on this server"). [Rivecoder]
		+	- Added the CCMD "cancelvote", which can be used by the server or original vote caller to cancel the current vote. [Rivecoder]
		+	- Added the CVAR "sv_minvoters", which lets the server specify the minimum number of players needed to call a vote (default 1). [Rivecoder]
		-	- Fixed a bug where the wrong player could be kicked by a votekick. [Rivecoder]
		-	- Fixed: spectators could vote "yes" or "no" even when sv_nocallvote was set to 2. [Rivecoder]
		!	- The default minimum of eligible voters is now 1. [Rivecoder]
		!	- The "VOTE PASSED!" string is now drawn at the top of the screen. [Rivecoder]
		!	- Votes now run for a shorter duration. [Rivecoder]
		!	- After voting, the "vote" screen is now hidden. [Rivecoder]
		!	- You can no longer kickvote yourself. [Rivecoder]
+	- Extended the OpenGL wallhack protection to catch the updated version of the hack. Kudos to SuperGod for providing extensive background information on how to resolve this. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Added new actor flag PUFFGETSOWNER to flags5. If selected, the owner of the puff is set to the player who fired it. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Converted BFG10K, GrenadeLauncher, RandomPowerup, TeamItem, Flag, Skull, WhiteFlag, FloatyIcon, PathNode, ReturnZone, SpringPadZone, Hissy, MaxHealth, RuneGiver, RedArmor, PowerTerminatorArtifact, PowerPossessionArtifact, various invasion spawner base classes and various Rune classes to DECORATE. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Converted Cacolantern, Abaddon, Belphegor, BloodDemon, Hectebus and SuperShotgunGuy to DECORATE. [Karate Chris, The Doom Master, Theshooter7, Gez, Torr Samaho]
+	- Actor flag NONETID is now available in DECORATE. Actors with this flag are not assigned a network id when spawned. Only use it, if you know what you are doing! [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added 11 new game mode types to SBarInfo.  They are as follows: ctf, oneflagctf, skulltag, invasion, possession, teampossession, lastmanstanding, teamlms, survival, instagib, and buckshot. [Blzut3]
+	- Added runeicon to SBarInfo's drawimage. [Blzut3]
+	- Vastly improved the server's DMFlags dialog. [Rivecoder]
		- Sorted the flags into clear, logical groups.
		- You can now type in new flags values directly, and see the checkboxes update in real time.
		- Added missing flags, clarified the description of many, and fixed a few bugs.
+	- Added the ability to ignore an annoying player's chat messages! Use the new CCMDS "ignore" and "unignore". [Rivecoder, Torr Samaho]
		+	- You can also ignore the player for n minutes by using "ignore <name> n". [Rivecoder]
		+	- Added a menu to easily select a player. [Rivecoder]
+	- When an IP address is banned, all players using that address are now immediately kicked. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added teamscore to SBarInfo's drawnumber and drawbar.  Its takes one parameter for team name. [Blzut3]
+	- Added new CCMD demo_skiptonextmap. When playing a client side demo, this command jumps the playback to the next map change. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_useteamstartsindm (default false). If true, team starts will be used when possible in deathmatch game modes with teams, e.g. TDM, TLMS. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added support for GZDoom's alternate HUD. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "old radius damage", controlled by the new CVAR compat_oldradiusdmg. If this is enabled, the original Doom radius damage code is used, i.e. explosions have infinite vertical range. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_logfiletimestamp_usedate. If enabled, the current date "YY:MM:DD" is prepended to the per-line timestamp of the logfile. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new DECORATE weapon property "preferredskin". While the PreferredSkin value of a player's ready weapon is equal to a skin available to the player's class, the player is forced to use this skin, overriding any personal skin settings. This allows to easily create mods were one can see from the skin which weapon the other players are currently using. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR cl_soundwhennotactive (default true). If enabled, the Windows client will keep playing sound as normal when the client is not the currently active application. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Extended the launcher protocol to allow launchers to handle one stable version (e.g. 97d3) and one testing version (e.g. 97e-alpha) side by side. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- You can now specify the IP Skulltag binds its network socket to with "-useip IP". If used, Skulltag only listens on that IP for incoming traffic and uses the corresponding NIC for outgoing traffic. If not specified, Skulltag listens on all NICs, but uses the default NIC for outgoing traffic. May be useful when hosting a server on a machine with multiple NICs to select which one to use. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR gl_use_models (default true). If false, all sprite model replacements are ignored. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "no rocket jumping", controlled by the new CVAR sv_norocketjumping. If enabled, P_RadiusAttack doesn't give players any z-momentum if the attack was made by a player. This essentially disables rocket jumping. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Revamped the ZDoom dmflag "kill monsters", controlled by the CVAR DF2_KILL_MONSTERS. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
		- When the exit is blocked, the player is now teleported back to a random start. This fixes problems when the exit was blocked and the player passed an exit line.
		- The flag is now only used in cooperative game modes, doesn't make much sense in other modes.
		- Added new CVAR sv_killallmonsters_percentage (default 100) that allows to specify how many percent of the monsters have to be killed before the level can be exited.
		- If the flag is used, the scoreboard now displays how many percent of the monsters are still alive instead of the absolute number.
+	- Added new ACS script flag CLIENTSIDE. Scripts with this flag are only executed on the clients, not on the server. Therefore, such scripts should not need any network bandwidth while running (only the server instruction that tells the clients to start the script needs bandwidth). Only use it on scripts that don't affect the game in any way (visuals aside) and only use it, if you know what you are doing! [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the launcher protocol to optionally report the MD5 sum of the main data file (skulltag.wad/skulltag_data.pk3) the server uses. The sum is also shown on startup in the console log. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CCMD countactors that counts the number of actors currently in the game, shows how many of them have a network id and how many actors are of which class. [Torr Samaho]
+	- In levels with a team selection room, the player's inventory is not given until a team has been picked. [Blzut3, Torr Samaho]
+	- sv_maxteams to select between 2, 3, and 4 team games.  4 teams are defined in Skulltag: blue, red, green, and gold. [Blzut3]
+	- Extended the master server protocol so that the packets sent by the master containing the server list never exceed 1024 byte. Furthermore, servers with the same IP are sent in blocks now (kudos to bond for this idea), vastly reducing the amount of traffic necessary for the list. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "force gl defaults", controlled by the new CVAR sv_forcegldefaults. If this is enabled, some default OpenGL rendering options are enforced, i.e. clients render as if gl_lightmode == 3 and gl_light_ambient == 20.0. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps to check all DEHACKED lumps. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- The new ingame class selection join menu is now also used in non-team based game modes, allowing to select from an arbitrary number of classes. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVARs sv_coop_loseinventory, sv_coop_losekeys, sv_coop_loseweapons, sv_coop_losearmor, sv_coop_losepowerups, sv_coop_loseammo and sv_coop_halveammo to control the corresponding dmflags. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the effect of the MAPINFO flag "islobby": Maps with this flag now behave as if sv_keepteams is false. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The name and location of Skulltag's data file (skulltag_data.pk3/skulltag.wad) can be specified with "-skulldata NAME". [Torr Samaho]
+	- When the Windows server crashes, it tries to kick all clients before it shuts down. That way the clients have a chance to notice that the server crashed instead of seeing the "waiting for server" message forever. (implementation for Linux planned). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "clients send full button info", controlled by the new CVAR compat_clientssendfullbuttoninfo. This needs to be enabled to make the ACS function GetPlayerInput work on server side scripts with buttons other than BT_ATTACK, BT_USE, BT_JUMP, BT_CROUCH, BT_TURN180, BT_ALTATTACK, BT_RELOAD and BT_ZOOM. Because it increases net traffic, it should only be activated if needed. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "no land", controlled by the new CVAR compat_noland. If this is enabled, players are not allowed to use the land CCMD anymore. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed errors while compiling and running 64-bit versions of Skulltag. [Blzut3]
-	- The fire background for player setup and class select was not scaled properly. [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed crash problems with the bots in the 64-bit version of Skulltag. [Blzut3, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed error in SECTINFO parser where only one property could be set per map header. [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed bots shoot behind them in 64-bit. [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed: Under certain circumstance inactive SwitchableDecoration actors were treated as active on the clients. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In the first map of client side demos the player always started with the fist as ready weapon. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a map change in client side demos the player possibly started with the wrong ready weapon. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The client didn't properly confirm the weapon change that happens when a Tome of Power expires. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a client was given a health item, e.g. a stimpack, it always thought that item had the default amount, ignoring the amount specified. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Enter scripts of bots are never executed online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a non-spectator player spies through the eyes of someone else, weapon bob doesn't work. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: BelphegorBall overrode the SpawnID of BaronBall. BelphegorBall now has SpawnID 222. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Clients tried to calculate the movement of the other players instead of only relying on the server to do this. The effects of this were nearly unnoticeable, but become apparent if used with the accurate ping code. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Bad things happened when the server used the CCMDs spectate or join. Now they simply are ignored when issued through the server console or RCON. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The client calculated falling damage on its own instead of relying on the server. This could cause sync issues where a client thought it's dead, when it wasn't. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Negative frag counts of teams are not displayed properly in the new fullscreen HUD if text scaling is deactivated. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If the client was instructed by the server to destroy an actor of type PlayerPawn, the client didn't erase the corresponding pointer to it in the player array. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Detection of the local IP under FreeBSD did not work properly. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If no useable network port was found, no proper error message was shown. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Random state jumps on player weapons weren't synchronized online at all. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_PlaySoundEx didn't always work properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Loading bot script lumps from PK3s/ZIPs didn't work. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Autoselecting a team wouldn't work properly if you were put in line. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: The code that enforces the name restrictions on player names under some circumstances led to escaped, incomplete color codes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The DarkImp never used its melee attack. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: ACS scripts using LocalAmbientSound could crash the server if a player left and rejoined while the script was running. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The mapinfo properties clipmidtextures, wrapmidtextures and checkswitchrange were lost after a map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the error handling when there are no more free network ids: The server now aborts the current game and restarts the map. In addition, the CCMD countactors is called to help analyzing the situation. In single player, there are no more error messages related to network ids. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The code to check the maximal allowed effective skin sprite width/height still checked some textures it shouldn't have checked. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: SetLineTexture didn't work online if the desired texture name was "". [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: It was possible to join "NO TEAM" [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed: Using changemap or nextmap after a map was aborted by a recoverable error caused Skulltag to crash. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Improved the client side movement prediction of a monster with CANTLEAVEFLOORPIC if the the monster touches the boundary of the floorpic region. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After changing the gamemode in the general settings window of the Windows serverconsole, the map restart dialog wasn't always shown. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The RCON utility did not work with Linux servers. [Blzut3, Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: If the main game thread froze, the server close button wouldn't do anything. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: The Windows welcome screen didn't take into account the gl_nogl CVAR setting. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Monsters using A_Recoil to move suffered from severe sync issues. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Clients sometimes spawned 3D floors locally when they shouldn't or didn't spawn them when they should. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Spectators in a teamgame mode were possibly assigned to spawn in a team spot of a team that doesn't have any such spots on the current map, causing the whole game to be aborted. Furthermore, spectators were never spawned on starts of the second team. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: When SetPlayerProperty is used to remove PROP_INVULNERABILITY from a player, that player's body is still rendered with the invulnerability color map. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The CCMD pings didn't display the correct ping values. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Domination didn't show the score on the status bar. [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed: When respawning online in a cooperative game mode after selecting a different player class, a player keeps the old inventory (if the dmflags say so) instead of getting a completely fresh inventory based on the new player class selected. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In lms/teamlms players possibly got weapons that should have been filtered out by the game actor property. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: When a player left the game online (either by disconnecting of by changing to a spectator) his running scripts were not terminated. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The internal server browser didn't understand the "You are banned" response from the master server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The CCMD playerinfo crashed when an invalid player number was used as argument. Furthermore, fixed the spacing and the wrongly displayed special character in the SwitchOnPickup line. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The jump sound of the local player stutters online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a map change with intermission online, the console player body lost any non default flags on the client (e.g. NOGRAVITY and FLY when the player had the fly cheat). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If SetActorProperty was used to set the APROP_Health property of a player online, only the client directly affected by the health change was informed about the changed property. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A client could be wrongly kicked for level authentication failure, if two (or more) map changes happen too quickly in a row. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Items that used certain code pointers (e.g. A_GiveInventory) during the first tic of their Pickup state didn't work properly online if used as start items of a player. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Newly connecting clients were not informed about the team scores in team possession and domination. Furthermore, they were not informed about the individual player frags in game modes where the CVAR teamgame is true. [Torr Samaho, Blzut3]
-	- Fixed: Things removed by A_FadeOut are not restored when a map resets. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Friendly monsters possibly chased spectators when using A_Wander. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a map reset online the sector special denoting whether a secret sector was already revealed was not reset on the clients. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: After a map reset, sectors manipulated by Floor_Waggle or Ceiling_Waggle are not properly reset to their initial position. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Skulltag froze on startup when encountering a non empty SKININFO lump that doesn't have at least one bracket pair or that has an incomplete bracket pair. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Newly connecting clients are not informed about the current health or ammo of the players already in the game. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed some player state sync problems online, e.g. a client possibly put a player body into the missile state though it should be in the pain state. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed problems with campaigns on maps with an 8 character name. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The botskillpicname sprite in a botepisode menu was not centered correctly when it was a scaled graphic. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When the CVAR screenshot_dir is empty under Linux, Skulltag tries to put screenshots in ~/.zdoom/screenshots/ instead of ~/.skulltag/screenshots/. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Some crashes that happened when a player got / had an armor with an invalid inventory icon. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The game crashes, when you exit the game in single player while spying through the eyes of a bot. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When the TID of an actor is changed online on the server by Thing_ChangeTID, the clients connected are not informed about the TID change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The rain spawned by SkullRodPowered online is translated according to the translation of player 1 and not the player that fired the weapon. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When using sv_awarddamageinsteadkills 1 in survival / survival invasion, the player scores are not reset when the map is reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Map spawned actors that use certain kind of code pointers in their spawn state (e.g. A_SpawnItemEx) possibly were not properly reset during a map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Spectators could trigger hit floor/ceiling sector actions offline. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If you are spying someone online while the spied one is turning into a spectator, your eyes return to your body, but your status bar keeps being locked to the player you spied. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Hopefully fixed: When a player dies and turns into a dead spectator (e.g. in survival/survival invasion/(T)LMS), the spectator body possibly gets stuck. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In cooperative game modes, ArtiTeleport only works properly for players that have designated starts on the current map. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If you are spying someone online in survival and the spied one dies, your eyes return to your body even if the died player still has lives left. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Increased Software's freelook to +-56 degrees (in otherwords you can now look up as much as you could down). This is done to reduce the advantage of OpenGL. The old limit can be restored with the new CVAR cl_oldfreelooklimit (default false). [Blzut3, Torr Samaho]
!	- Disabled screen wipes on the clients, since they cause more harm than good there. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The SECTINFO parser supports use with the LANGUAGE lump to allow translatable locations. [Blzut3]
!	- Merged S_SKIN and SKININFO. [Blzut3, Torr Samaho]
!	- The Windows server now runs on above-normal priority. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- The server now reports the full version (including the revision number) over the launcher protocol. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- The player name restrictions are now also applied to the CVAR name itself, not only to the actually used netname value. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The "kill monsters" cheat can now be used by the server (independent of the sv_cheats setting). [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- To restore compatibility with ZDoom, ACS scripts with the NET flag are not treated to be client side anymore. The new compatflag "net scripts are client side", controlled by the new CVAR compat_netscriptsareclientside, allows to restore the old Skulltag behavior. After changing the flag, the map should be restarted. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The code to check the maximal allowed effective skin sprite width/height now reports the offending sprite names in case the allowed dimensions are exceeded. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Going to intermission now automatically stops any active vote. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- If a client pukes an ACS script with the NET flag, it now requests the server to run the script instead of silently running it client side on its own. If you want the script to be run client side, either give it the CLIENTSIDE flag or use compat_netscriptsareclientside. [Torr Samaho]
!	- For security reasons, aliases can't be called by ConsoleCommand anymore. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The Linux server console now flushes the output buffer.  This allows other programs, such as Doomseeker, to easily capture the standard input and output. [Blzut3]
!	- If cheats are disabled, clients are not allowed to use the CCMD testfade anymore. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- Spectators don't get the default inventory anymore when initially spawned. This is now consistent with the fact that players who turn to spectators after already being in the game lose all their inventory. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Spectators are now always allowed to use freelook. [SuperGod, Torr Samaho]
!	- Removed Skulltag's custom player corpse queue, instead the original ZDoom system is used now. Because of this the CVAR cl_maxcorpses is no longer available (as in ZDoom, the corpse queue size is now fixed to 32). This change should resolve the problems that player corpses change their color seemingly randomly. It also fixes the problems that could occur if a client uses a smaller cl_maxcorpses value than the server. Unfortunately, due to a GZDoom bug, this only fixes the color problems in the software renderer. [Torr Samaho]
!	- skulltag_data.pk3 is now loaded instead of skulltag.wad. If skulltag_data.pk3 is not found, Skulltag tries to load skulltag.wad. [Torr Samaho]
! 	- A player whose IP is on the admin list can't be targeted by a kickvote anymore. [Torr Samaho]
! 	- The CVAR name can't exceed 31 characters (the netname length limit) anymore. [Torr Samaho]
! 	- In true single player mode (i.e. offline and with no multiplayer emulation) if there is no custom F1 textures defined via MAPINFO for the current map, the standard help screen is shown instead of Skulltag's game-sensitive F1 help screens. [Torr Samaho]
!	- When a player starts chat spamming, he is now muted instead of kicked. [Rivecoder]


v0.97d5-security-update-1
-------------------------

+	- Extended the server side client command protection to protect from commands the client is allowed to use often, but that still can be abused for a DOS attack. If a client floods the server with such commands (more than 100 in 10 seconds), the client is kicked and banned for 10 minutes. Commands of this type include toggling the console, toggling chat status and taunting. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]

v0.97d5
-------

+	- Added server side client command protection. If a client floods the server with protected commands (more than 6 in 60 seconds), the client is kicked and banned for 10 minutes. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Certain kinds of chat messages that only consist of color codes and white spaces wiped out all other messages currently on the screen. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Parsing ban, white or admin list under Linux could crash. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The server doesn't relay chat messages that only consist of color codes and white spaces anymore. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]

v0.97d4
-------

+	- Extended the authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps to check all lumps included by DECORATE lumps and all ACS library lumps included by LOADACS lumps. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The map authentication didn't cover the BEHAVIOR lump. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps now allows Freedoom/Doom clients to join Doom/Freedoom servers. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a server was queried for unknown flags, these flags were not removed from the Flags field in the answer. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The clients crashed if the server sent them malformed packets. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d3-security-update-1
-------------------------

-	- Fixed a critical security bug of the server. Thanks a lot to kgsws for submitting a detailed report on this issue along with an implementation of the exploit. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A malicious client could skip the map authentication. Thanks to kgsws for his detailed report on this. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The RCON utility crashed when somebody said a chat string with "%n" or similar printf compatible format parameters. Again thanks to kgsws for reporting. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: All line breaks are removed from the comment when an entry is added to the banlist or whitelist. Thanks to kgsws for pointing me to this. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d3
-------

+	- Several improvements to the RCON utility: [Rivecoder]
		- Added support for favorites, with stored addresses and passwords.
		- Added a tray icon to which you can hide the window, and from which you can launch favorites.
		- Added file version metadata and an "about" screen.
		- Fixed: If you tried to reconnect to a nonexistent server, you wouldn't get 3 retries.
+	- The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps now gives detailed warnings on which auto-loaded files contain which protected lumps. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_suddendeath (default true). If set to false, CTF or Skulltag games don't go into sudden death mode when the time limit is hit and no team has more points than all other teams. Instead the game is considered to be a draw. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new MAPINFO flag "islobby". If a duel is made on a map with this flag, the countdown and the map reset are skipped, e.g. useful for a map selection map like AlexMan's duel16. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The code to check the maximum allowed effective skin sprite width/height didn't work with UDMX under Linux. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: For the purpose of sv_smartaim, players of different teams were considered to be friends in non-deathmatch based team game modes, e.g. CTF. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: A client possibly crashed when the server instructed it to spawn blood of an actor the client doesn't know. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The network traffic needed by Sector_SetFade and Sector_SetColor increased linearly with the number of sectors that have the given tag instead of being constant. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: If the model flag rotation-speed was used with a value other than 1, the rotation "skipped" every five seconds. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Friendly actors or actors using A_Chase or A_LookEx could cause the server to freeze completely when the first player connects or the last player disconnects. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The one and five minute announcer warnings didn't work at all for clients. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: The network traffic needed by SetLineTexture increased linearly with the number of lines that have the given identification number instead of being constant. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The ACS command SectorSound didn't work properly online if it was called by a line. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Under certain circumstance inactive BatSpawners were treated as active on the clients. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The chat sound was played even when messages are disabled. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Unfinished client connections to the server didn't timeout properly. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Teleport_EndGame caused the server to get stuck. Nevertheless, end sequences are not supported online. They are just skipped. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The CCMDs dumpmap, initpolymosttest, quickload, quicksave, select, slot, togglemap and vid_setmode caused the server to crash instead of being ignored. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When the server changed the map while a newly connected client was still loading the map, this client didn't get informed about the map change causing severe sync issues. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: If you died in co-op and somebody else ended the map before you respawned, you would start the next map with only default inventory, no matter what dmflags was set to. (ported from ZDoom revision 691). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Under rare circumstances a client could crash while connecting. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Some kind of puffs were not spawned in their crash or melee state on the clients online. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Sounds of puffs in the melee or crash state were not played on the clients online. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Projectiles killing a player, never entered their Crash or XDeath state. [Torr Samaho]
!	- There is now a 10 second time limit on joining. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- There is now a 30 second time limit on name changes for clients. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- CVAR timelimit now also applies to cooperative game modes. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- Further tuned the UPnP code to make it compatible with more routers. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d3 RC2
-----------

-	- Fixed: When using the CCMD kill in the console, the "in console" icon over the player's head was not removed. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Detection of the local IP under Linux did not work properly. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The ScaleNx code messed up camera textures. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed some seemingly random problems occurring to clients in CTF or Skulltag games. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit that allowed to crash servers. Kudos to kgsws for submitting a detailed report on this issue. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Seemingly randomly clients completely froze in CTF / Skulltag. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Players are now notified that they can only pick up a team's flag if there are people on that team. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed the SSDP packet the server sends to find the UPnP root device. This should make the UPnP support compatible with more routers. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d3 RC1
-----------

*+	- Added temporary bans! [Rivecoder]
*+	- Added full TEAMINFO support across all game modes. [Karate Chris, Torr Samaho]
*+	- Optimized the actor spawning code. The name of the actors used to be sent across the network, but now only a 'short' is sent. [Karate Chris, Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added a custom implementation of the Scale2x/3x/4x algorithm as proposed in http://scale2x.sourceforge.net/ to the OpenGL renderer. This should get rid of the blurriness caused by OpenGL filtering and is controlled by the new CVAR gl_texture_hqresize, which defaults to 0. Textures/sprites whose width or height exceeds the new CVAR gl_texture_hqresize_maxinputsize (default 512) are not upsampled. The new CVAR gl_texture_hqresize_target (default 0) controls whether everything should be upsampled (value 0) or sprites and fonts only (value 1). [Torr Samaho]
		gl_texture_hqresize == 0 : no scaling
		gl_texture_hqresize == 1 : Scale2x algorithm
		gl_texture_hqresize == 2 : Scale3x algorithm
		gl_texture_hqresize == 3 : Scale4x algorithm
+	- Added UPnP support (invoked by the command line parameter "-upnp"). If used, the server tries to automatically add a port mapping on the router that connects the server to the internet. The external port of the mapping can be overridden by #n, if Skulltag is invoked with "-upnp #n". [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added medal families: "higher" medals, such as incredible, now immediately replace lower medals, such as excellent. This means that when on a spree, you can go right from excellent to incredible, accuracy to precision, impressive to most impressive, and so on without waiting for the lower medal to slide off. Overall this makes the queue run a lot faster, especially if you have a large backlog of medals. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added an "in console" icon that's shown above a player's head when he's in the menu or console. [Rivecoder, Torr Samaho]
+	- The five/one minute warning announcer sounds are now played. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added chat substitution inspired by ZDoom. [Karate Chris]
+	- Added a chat sound for Strife. [Karate Chris]
+	- Added a 'singleplayer' console command, complimentary to the 'multiplayer' / 'netgame' console command. [Karate Chris]
+	- Added CKeen's submission for an updated Italian language file. [Karate Chris]
+	- Significantly reduced the net traffic used by P_MoveThing, e.g. used by SetActorPosition. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added basic SECTINFO support, currently only displayed in coop info. The SECTINFO parser supports use with the LANGUAGE lump to allow translatable locations. [Blzut3]
+	- Added Domination as a built in game mode. [Blzut3, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new actor property "limitedtoteam", currently only has any effect when applied to a player class: When a player joins a team with a player class that is limited to be used only by another team, the player is immediately respawned with the first class that is open to the team just joined. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Improved Skulltag's response to DOS attacks. Players will be able to keep on playing even if the server is being massively attacked (by several hundred computers or more). In that case, Skulltag will shut off all new connections until the attack subsides. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added new team class selection menu: When joining a team from the team selection menu and more than one player class is available, there now is a menu that lets you select among the available classes (respects limitedtoteam). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "award damage dealt instead of kills", controlled by the new CVAR sv_awarddamageinsteadkills. If enabled, a player gets one point per 100 damage dealt and doesn't get any extra points for killing monsters. The scaling is done, so that players don't get outrageous amounts of points. Internally no rounding is done, so you'll get your points no matter if you dealt the damage in one or in several attacks. The flag works in all gamemodes, where kills are awarded (coop, survival, invasion). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added NOINTERACTION flag which completely disables all physics related code for any actor with this flag. Mostly useful for particle effects where the actors just move a certain distance and then disappear. (ported from ZDoom revision 876). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a new entry to the HUD options menu to toggle cl_drawcoopinfo. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new DECORATE actor flag CLIENTSIDEONLY. The server doesn't spawn such actors, the clients spawn them on their own. Therefore, they never should need any network bandwidth. Only use it on actors that don't affect the game in any way (visuals aside) and only use it, if you know what you are doing! [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "force alpha", controlled by the new CVAR sv_forcealpha. If this is enabled, clients are enforced to display alpha, i.e. render as if r_drawtrans == 1. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the cvar sv_enforcemasterbanlist; if true, the server enforces the master server's banlist. This is totally optional and is provided as a convenience to the server hoster and Skulltag staff. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added new command ClearBots to BOTINFO (has to be used outside the braces), that clears all previously defined bots (including Skulltag's hardcoded bots). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Banned clients are now told the reason for their ban. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added new DECORATE weapon flag NOAUTOAIM. Weapons with this flag behave as if CVAR autoaim was 0 (as long as the level allows freelook). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "no crosshair", controlled by the new CVAR compat_nocrosshair. If this is enabled, clients are not allowed to use a crosshair. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
+	- Added new compatflag "old weapon switch", controlled by the new CVAR compat_oldweaponswitch. If this is enabled, players always switch weapons on pickup (as in vanilla Doom). [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed a positioning bug with rank/spread on the classic HUD when st_scale was off. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: the 'ColorSetter' and 'FadeSetter' actors were broken online. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: SKININFO skins couldn't use sounds from the Sounds subdirectory of PK3s/ZIPs. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Save games were missing the number of remaining Archviles in Invasion. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The Logitech G15 code possibly caused a crash after a map change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a player is respawned online with a different player class than before, neither the skin nor the translation of this player is adjusted to the new class on the clients. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A client entering a LMS/TeamLMS server crashes, if the wads running on the server give the player no starting weapon at all. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The server statistics for total data transfer in and out overflowed at 2 gigabyte. Now no overflow should occur before 16 exabyte of traffic are reached. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a player disconnected or changed to a spectator while being morphed, various problems occurred. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a player is killed online, its death view doesn't follow the killer. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a player turns into a spectator, the currently active sounds associated to it are not stopped. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Using weapnext or weapprev while recording a single player demo crashed the game. Nevertheless, single player demos are not supported and will go out of sync quickly. Use client demos instead. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Some sight check related problems in A_DoChase occurred in games with more than one player. Offline this caused monsters to move strangely, online this caused monster movement sync issues. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Spectators could trigger sector transitions offline. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The scoreboard of the win32 server console is not updated when changing to intermission. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The game crashed while spawning a player in certain game modes (e.g. lms), when certain inventory items (e.g. weapons) were replaced by actors that are not inventory items. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When entering the name of the save game in the save menu, the underscore denoting the cursor position is possibly displayed too far to the right. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The points of the teams in team possession are not displayed on the new fullscreen HUD if text scaling is activated. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A single malformed packet could possibly crash any client. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Under rare circumstances the server crashed when creating a FlashFader. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: If an actor is spawned client side with A_SpawnItemEx, A_SpawnItemEx calls without the client side flag made by this actor don't spawn anything at all. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Bots were not affected by PROP_FROZEN or PROP_TOTALLYFROZEN. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Player names ending with "\c" caused various glitches. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The ACS function CreateTranslation with syntax "a:b=[red1,green1,blue1]:[red2,green2,blue2]" didn't work properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The code to check the maximum allowed effective skin sprite width/height checked some textures it shouldn't have checked. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a spectator that is waiting in line leaves the game, the join queue is not updated properly. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a map change in CTF/ST to a map without a team selection room, the players who were waiting in line in the previous map were not removed from their join queue positions. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Under some conditions one could exit a map during the countdown in survival, e.g. with line special LS_Teleport_NewMap. Now players trying to exit during the countdown are killed. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Several code pointers didn't work properly online in the death state of a player, e.g. A_PlaySound. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The ACS command FadeTo didn't work online if the last argument (seconds) was 0.0. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Under certain conditions the CMPGNINF parser didn't accept proper botteam entries. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Player classes using certain code pointers caused "ghost" players to appear under certain conditions. For example this affected Sjas in GvH. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Under certain circumstances changing the CVAR playerclass messed up the ColorRange property of the console player skin (fixed itself upon respawning). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Removed the default values for sv_motd, sv_website, and sv_hostemail. sv_motd would show the wrong version over time, and the others should be blank if not set by the server hoster. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: Online a player and all its corpses used the same translation, i.e. if a player changed his color all corpses of this player changed their color too. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The new fullscreen HUD doesn't respect the maxhealth property of the current player class. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Instagib ignored the ammo types of Railgun replacements. [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed: After changing the map online or a map reset, the game possibly crashes when using cl_stfullscreenhud == false. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: ParticleFountain doesn't work properly online for the first player that connects to a server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Things like DeadDemon are not spawned on the clients online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Legacy-style 3D floors/liquid linetypes didn't work for Doom-format maps. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed up the display of medals when you have the key down. Higher medals are now on the right, opposite their subordinates. [Rivecoder]
!	- Each player's "ready to go on" status, shown at the intermission, can now only be turned on. Hopefully, this will help clear up what this command is for and prevent rapid toggling of it. [Rivecoder]
!	- Rank/Spread is no longer drawn if there's only one player. [Rivecoder]
!	- Armor is no longer drawn on the new HUD if you don't have any. [Rivecoder]
!	- You can now join the game while spectating during intermission. [Rivecoder]
!	- You no longer have to wait 10 seconds to change your team during the team last man standing countdown. [Karate Chris]
!	- Changed: The FLOATBOB flag is not applied to spectators anymore, no matter if the corresponding player class has it or not. Furthermore, spectators now always have flags3 = MF3_NOBLOCKMONST, flags4 = 0 and flags5 = 0. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Spectators now always have forwardmove 1, sidemove 1 and viewheight 41 (default values from PlayerPawn), no matter how the values of the corresponding player class are. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Spectators are fixed in their spawn state and don't execute any code pointers. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: If a player selects the "Random" player class, a new class is selected randomly every time the player respawns. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: In a single player campaign with a team based game mode, you can now rejoin after spectating with the in game join team menu, if you select the team the campaign wants you to have. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Hard-coded bots have been exported to BOTINFO. [Blzut3]
!	- Changed: If ArtiTeleport is used in a team game and the user is on a team with valid starts on the current map, the user is now teleported to a random team start of the user's team. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: GrenadeLauncher doesn't auto aim anymore (it now has the NOAUTOAIM weapon flag). [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d2
-------

-	- Fixed: The sv_maxclientsperip code didn't take into account timeouts of non finished connection attempts. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: the pissed of player face should not work in spectator mode. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: In game modes that reset, P_DoCrunch and A_BarrelDestroy gave the actor to be destroyed the MF_NOBLOCKMAP flag without unlinking it from the blockmap by calling UnlinkFromWorld(). This possibly caused some strange survival crashes. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Monsters that are alive when a countdown is started in Invasion are not handled properly causing online sync problems. Clients wrongly deleted friendly monsters locally two waves after they have been spawned. Furthermore, the server deleted living hostile monsters that didn't come from an Invasion spawner without notifying the clients about this. Now all living hostile monsters (that can only exist because of bugs or cheats anyway) are deleted when the countdown is started. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: In game modes that reset, the server tells newly connecting clients to spawn certain kind of actors even though they are already destroyed, e.g. exploded ExplosiveBarrels. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: When a player respawns while a time freezer owned by another player is active, the respawned player can't move anymore as long as the freezer is active. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: In cooperative game modes, when the players travel from any map to a map with fewer player starts than players, some of them may end up in a zombie like state. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: When an Archvile raises a monster online, on the clients the total monsters counter is increased by two instead of one. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: If an invasion monster spawner is hijacked to spawn something that is not a monster, the remaining monster count is not adapted accordingly. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In game modes that reset, when an actor is hidden instead of being destroyed, P_DelSector_List() is not called. This caused some strange survival crashes. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: If there is only one player class, the client tells the server that it's going to send the name of it's class (on connect and when changing the CVAR playerclass), but didn't actually do so. This led to network packet parsing errors on the server. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: In game modes that reset when using COMPATF_LIMITPAIN, hidden lost souls were counted to the number of lost souls when checking if a pain elemental may spawn a new lost soul. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: When a client is kicked because of user info change flood, the server doesn't finish parsing the user info packet, resulting in network packet parsing errors. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The line special Ceiling_CrushStop doesn't work properly online, the crusher is stopped on the server but continues to move on the clients. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: The server doesn't inform the clients about the arguments of the SoundEnvironment actor. This prevented reverbs from working online. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: A_PlaySound and similar functions didn't work online on actors that don't have a net id, e.g. Blood and derived actors. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: A minor grammar error in the possession scoreboard code. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Instead of crashing the game when being called twice, AActor::UnlinkFromWorld() now just gives a warning to signal that a bug in the code was encountered. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Calling a vote during intermission is not allowed anymore. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- Changed: Clients can't set the CVAR turbo higher than 100 anymore. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
!	- Changed: For consistency with the handling of the CVARs dmflags and dmflags2, the value of the CVAR compatflags is not archived in the ini any more. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]

v0.97d2 RC6
-----------

*+	- Optimized the monster movement code. Under some circumstances this drastically decreases network traffic. Compare map09 of dr2008v2.zip to see an example, where a lot of bandwidth is saved. Special thanks to SuperGod for finding a way to reproduce the excessive net traffic. Without it, this problem would still silently be wasting net traffic. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_nodrop. If set to true on a server, clients can't use the drop CCMD online. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added constant SXF_CLIENTSIDE for the "client side spawn" option of A_SpawnItemEx. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The reflection rune's obituary would read "[victim] was killed via [victim]'s reflection rune". [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: Joining a survival invasion server with "start as spectator" off would make you join immediately.  [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: Clients sometimes accidentally switch the weapon of one of the other players locally. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a typo in the callvote code. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed a typo in the BFG10k's obituary. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed the fake players exploit; introduced sv_maxclientsperip, which defaults to 2. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed an exploit in the name code which allowed invisible names. [Rivecoder]
-	- Fixed: Clients may completely freeze, i.e. get stuck in an infinite loop, when handling actors with a looping death state that loops over multiple frames, but doesn't loop back to the beginning of the death state. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The first player waiting in line in a survival invasion game joins the game when one of the in game players leave. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After using the CCMD map on the server, clients may accidentally be blocked for 10 seconds before they can enter the new map. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Clients are not informed if the current sky differs from the default map sky when connecting to a server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In competitive game modes with sv_noexit == true, players are not killed when trying to exit a map while being in a sector with sector special 75 (dDamage_End). This happened for example in exec.wad on map09. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed online monster sync problems involving the MF2_BLASTED flag. Among others, this affected A_RadiusThrust. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The 'GetPlayerInfo' ACS command didn't return the correct team. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: Maps using ACS possibly crash during a map reset. Kudos to SuperGod for finding a way to reproduce this nasty bug! [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a client disconnects from a server, then changes its name in the console, and then reconnects, the server is not informed about the name change. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A single malformed packet could crash any server. Again thanks to Luigi Auriemma for a detailed report on this issue. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Assigning a net id to a moving ceiling used much more CPU time than necessary. This caused certain wads to be displayed at less than 1 fps. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed some map change related crashes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Thing_Hate caused serious monster position sync issues online. [Torr Samaho, SuperGod]
-	- Fixed: Removing SectorAction and derived actors in game modes that reset, didn't remove those from the sector's list of actions. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Clients are now always informed when other players are pressing any attack buttons. This is done in a way that doesn't increase net traffic at all and fixes several problems: [Torr Samaho]
		- Now fully fixed: Attack animations are not always displayed properly in demos if you are spying a player that you didn't spy when recording the demo.
		- When using coop spy, other players may get stuck in the attack state locally.
!	- Changed default value of the CVAR sv_showwarnings to false. Should only be turned on for debugging purposes. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Increased the packet buffer size from 256 to 1024. Hopefully this reduces the chance of being forced to quit a network game due to packet loss. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The maximum allowed effective skin sprite width/height is now limited corresponding to the width/radius of the player class the skin belongs to. This fixes an exploit of the skin dir. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Added the ALLOWCLIENTSPAWN flag to the DynamicLight actor. This fixes that map spawned dynamic lights are not working online, but comes with the drawbacks of ALLOWCLIENTSPAWN. [Torr Samaho, Karate Chris]
!	- Renamed the Heretic spawner HexenGhostSpot to HereticGhostSpot. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d2 RC3
-----------

+	- Completely NEW and expanded encryption of the executable, so that hacking it is now even more difficult than before. [SuperGod]
+	- Added support for OpenGL texture compression. Depending on the GPU capabilities up to four new texture formats (COMPR_RGBA, S3TC_DXT1, S3TC_DXT3, S3TC_DXT5) are selectable with gl_texture_format. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Actor flag ALLOWCLIENTSPAWN is now available in DECORATE. The server doesn't tell clients to spawn actors with this flag, the clients spawn them on their own when loading the map. This is useful for decorations that will never be moved, removed, or changed in any way. Only use it, if you know what you are doing! [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CKeen's submission for an updated Italian language file. [Karate Chris]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_pure (default true). If set to false, the extended authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps is disabled. This is mainly intended for testing purposes and LAN play, official servers will always set sv_pure to true. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added UDP server console flood protection and improved the messages generated by unexpected challenges. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a workaround that allows to inform 97d-beta4.3 (or earlier) clients trying to connect to a 97d2 (or newer) server that there version is outdated. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The activator of the alarm should receive a message. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: The Sigil was broken client side. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: Strife's AlienSpectre, EntityBoss, Inquisitor, LoreMaster, Programmer's lightning, Sentinel and Templar didn't work properly online. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: Dead spectators aren't revived after a map change in survival invasion. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A single malformed packet could be use to freeze a server for about 5 seconds. Kudos to Luigi Auriemma for submitting a detailed report on this issue. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Coop info possibly covers the keys displayed in the fullscreen HUD. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Players may get stuck after a map reset in invasion. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The kill count is not reseted after a map reset in invasion. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Changes to the CVAR sv_maxlives are now applied on the next map change (like done with sv_cheats). This fixes the problems that previously occurred when changing sv_maxlives during a game. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d2 RC2
-----------

*+	- Added basic HUD model support. [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added survival invasion! In particular, added new CVAR sv_maxlives. This specifies how many times you are allowed to respawn in survival and invasion. sv_maxlives == 0 means no respawing in survival, but unlimited respawning in invasion. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added coop info display to show the status of the other players (health, armor, weapon, ammo) in cooperative game modes. Can be toggled by the new CVAR cl_drawcoopinfo. Inspired by the Zalewa/SuperGod enhanced version of VoltlocK's Ally Display. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added double definition support for the old DECORATE standard. In this case, the new actors override the old ones. [Rivecoder]
+	- Under Windows, choosing "browse servers" in the Multiplayer menu brings up a new menu, letting you choose between IDEse and the internal browser. Hopefully, this should prevent newbies getting stuck at the old browser. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added the CVAR chat_sound. With it, you can turn chat sounds off (0), play the default (1), or the Doom 2 (2) or Doom 1 (3) sounds. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added the dynamic light definitions for Strife made by Dark_Knight. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The error message of the float parser under Linux now mentions the LANG enviroment variable as possible cause for the error. [Torr Samaho]
+ 	- Added CVAR cl_allowmultipleannouncersounds (default true). If true, multiple announcer sounds can be played at once (like in 97D beta 4.3 and earlier), otherwise any announcer sound stops all previous announcers (like in 97D). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps to get rid of more exploits. [Torr Samaho]
+	- All the server side code that manipulates actors on the clients now checks for valid net ids. A warning is printed if it's not possible to manipulate an actor because of a missing net id. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added: sv_maxlives can now be configured from the "General settings" Windows server window. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_showwarnings (default true). If set to false, the new server side warning messages are suppressed. May be necessary for certain mods to prevent the warnings from flooding the log. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The 'summonfoe' console command didn't work online. [Karate Chris, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Using the CCMD stat crashes the server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_Chase doesn't work properly online when a custom missile or melee state is specified as argument. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Summoning a monster that doesn't count as a kill with the CCMD summonfriend messed up the invasion monster count online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If a spawn by A_SpawnItem or A_SpawnItemEx is blocked, the server still instructs the clients to spawn the thing, leading to a "ghost" actor on the clients. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Partially fixed: Attack animations are not displayed in demos if you are spying a player that you didn't spy when recording the demo. By design this has display problems with weapons using A_ReFire. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The summon commands should inform a client when an invalid class is specified. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: The Cleric's staff didn't animate correctly when draining health. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: 'A_SetBlend' didn't work online. [Karate Chris]
-	- Fixed: Heretic survival crashes within seconds after the countdown ends. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: SetFont() doesn't work properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_Mushroom possibly causes problems with the invasion monster count. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Level spawned actors revived by an Archvile aren't restored by GAME_ResetMap(). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Level spawned actors that have been respawned in nightmare aren't restored by GAME_ResetMap(). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Level spawned actors that have been removed by A_FreezeDeathChunks aren't restored by GAME_ResetMap(). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: GAME_ResetMap() didn't properly restore the total number of monsters in case of monsters that were not spawned by the map and removed during the game, e.g. killed lost souls spawned by a pain elemental. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Enter scripts were run twice in all game modes that reset (expect for invasion). For example this broke the custom HUD of sp_usimp.pk3 in survival. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If the ACS function SetActorPitch was called on a server, the clients were not notified about the updated pitch. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: No melee sound is played online by A_CustomComboAttack. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: For some actors the server tried but failed to instruct the clients to set the actor to a certain frame. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_Print crashes the server online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When starting a new survival game offline, while one is currently in progress, you immediately get "mission failed". [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed problems with A_Respawn online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In coop games a client didn't keep track of the ammo of other players when they were firing / reloading their weapons. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Spectators are now allowed to use chasecam in all game modes. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: When a jump is done online in A_JumpIfCloser, the server now synchronizes the actor position with the clients to reduce the sync issues caused by the client side monster movement. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Dormant actors are no longer removed in Invasion countdowns. [Rivecoder]
!	- Extended the 'sv_nocallvote' console variable. When 'sv_nocallvote' is at 0, all players can call votes, when it's at 1, no players can call votes, when it's at 2, only players in game can call votes. [Karate Chris]
!	- Removed the tediously annoying crouching console variable. [Karate Chris]
!	- Restored the plasma bump compat flag handling from the pre 97b era. This doesn't perfectly resemble the vanilla Doom behavior, but should be better than nothing. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The IWAD is now displayed in the internal browser. [Karate Chris]

v0.97d
------

+	- Added an authentication mechanism for several non-map related lumps to get rid of some exploits. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added flood protection to the drop/invdrop command. You can't use it online more than once per second anymore. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD kickfromgame_idx, works like kickfromgame but uses the player index instead of the name. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new inventory flag FORCERESPAWNINSURVIVAL. Items with this flag are respawned in survival even if sv_itemrespawn is false. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Damaging a charging lost soul online leads to serious sync issues regarding the lost soul between client and server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a z position client/server sync issue of floating monsters. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Enter scripts are not executed in team games when a spectator joins a team. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed exploit: Dropping ammo at baby and nightmare skill levels would give you back more than you dropped (ported from ZDoom revision 708). [Torr Samaho]
!	- The drop/invdrop command is not allowed online in non-cooperative game modes anymore. [Torr Samaho]
!	- RadSuit now has the FORCERESPAWNINSURVIVAL inventory flag. This was necessary because some maps are nearly impossible to finish in survival with sv_itemrespawn == false. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d RC10
-----------

*-	- Restored Windows 98/ME compatibility. [Torr Samaho, Rivecoder]
+	- Added one missing dmflag2 and seven missing compatflags to the "Configure DMFlags" server window. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD addbanexemption to add entries to the whitelist. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMDs delban and delbanexemption to remove entries from the banlist/whitelist. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD viewbanexemptionlist to print the whole whitelist. [Torr Samaho]
+	- If (sv_banfilereparsetime > 0) the whitelist is now reparsed in addition to the banlist. This also applies to the CCMD reloadbans. [Torr Samaho]
+ 	- Added admin list support. Clients with an IP on this list can now join even if the server is full. The new CVAR sv_adminlistfile specifies the filename of the list. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The red/blue team scores messages in CTF online are at the wrong position. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A successful kick vote doesn't kick the target. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A client with idmypos set to true crashes when connecting to a server. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In case cl_medals == true, carrier floating icons are not removed immediately after the carrier looses the item. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The new icon and medal hierarchy doesn't always prevent medals from overriding carrier icons. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The fraglimit code is executed on client and server, causing several problems. Among them is the incorrect number of wins display in duels online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Toggling the "Lose half ammo (CO-OP)" box in the "Configure DMFlags" server window doesn't automatically update the dmflags value in the window. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Thing_Remove doesn't properly remove invasion spawners. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: OPEN NET scripts are not executed on the clients online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: AActor::CopyFriendliness doesn't update the the invasion monster count. For example this fixes problems with friendly Painelementals in invasion. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Moved "Lose powerups (CO-OP)" and "Lose half ammo (CO-OP)" boxes to the DMFlags section of the "Configure DMFlags" server window. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Raised CLIENT_TIMEOUT from 25 to 40 seconds. This should fix the timeout problems after intermission in Heretic. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed the default value of vid_renderer to 0 (software renderer) to reduce compatibility problems with systems that can't use the GL renderer. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Increased the maximal number of servers that can be handled by the internal server browser from 256 to 512. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d RC9
----------

*+	- No more paper thin sprites: Added x/y axis billboard mode for sprite rendering! It is controlled by the new CVAR gl_billboard_mode, which defaults to 2. [Torr Samaho]
		gl_billboard_mode == 1 : y axis billboard (the way GZDoom renders sprites)
		gl_billboard_mode == 2 : x/y axis billboard (the mode countless of people have requested :D)
*+	- Added support for 3d floors in coop game modes, i.e. Coop, Survival and Invasion. [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added custom states and custom damage types (ported the change from ZDoom revision 368-378). [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added Linux OpenGL support! [Torr Samaho, Costja]
*+	- Completely revamped monster movement online! Monsters now move much more smoothly, and require far less bandwidth than before. [Carnevil]
*+	- Thoroughly updated Skulltag's ZDoom base to the latest ZDoom SVN repository revision (currently 622). [Torr Samaho 366-554+558-622, Carnevil 555-557]
*-	- Crash logs should finally work on all Windows machines. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a completely new 97d announcer that was made by SuperGod in a professional sound studio based on the voice of Carnevil. [SuperGod, Aabra, Carnevil, Rivecoder]
+	- Added new sprites for the Abaddon. [Jimmy91]
+	- Upgraded the GZDoom renderer to 1.0.29! [Torr Samaho 1.0.25-1.0.26+1.0.28-1.0.29, Carnevil 1.0.27]
+	- Added client-side scripts! Scripts with the NET tag are now purely executed on the client end. This reduces bandwidth usage, and allows things like custom HUD displays to work properly. [Carnevil]
+	- Added Logitech G15 support! Skulltag now natively supports a (fairly basic) LCD applet which displays the HUD, console, and a few other things. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added the dynamic light definitions for Heretic and Hexen from ZDoomGL. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added invasion spawners for Heretic! [Carnevil, Aabra, and Tun]
+	- Added invasion spawners for Hexen! [Gez, Torr Samaho]
+	- Enhanced the IWAD selection box, allowing users to see their version, select their IWAD, and set video settings. It also looks nicer. [Rivecoder]
+	- Improved the revision display in the console. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added the r_drawspectatingstring CVAR, which can be used to hide that message for screenshots or movies. [Rivecoder]
+	- Skulltag can be build and run without FMOD now (without sound, of course). This makes it possible to build servers for systems that FMOD doesn't support, like FreeBSD. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CVAR sv_markchatlines (default false). If set to true, all chat lines will be preceded by a string saying "CHAT " in the server console / logfile. This is to make the chat lines readily identifiable, necessary for MiX-MaN's IRC server control tool for example. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added Player.RunHealth property (ported the change from ZDoom revision 448). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Server console: you can now kick, ban, and IP check directly from the main scoreboard. [Rivecoder]
+	- Server console: when kicking or banning, reasons can now have spaces. [Rivecoder]
+	- Server console: added a statusbar - you can now see your IP, Public/Private/LAN status, current map, and version. [Rivecoder]
+	- Improved the display of the bottom string; 'x allies/opponent' display now reflects that of the player you're spying; added a few missing linebreaks. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added a GTK+ version of the IWAD selection box (ported the change from ZDoom revision 451). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Ported the updated startup screen code from GZDoom 1.0.24 to ST. This includes simulations of Heretic's, Hexen's and Strife's startup screen. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Class selection screen is now shown when joining a multiplayer non Hexen, not team based game with more than one available player class. [Torr Samaho]
+	- sv_banfile can now be a path, so that banfiles can be placed anywhere. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added "Class" to the player setup menu. [Carnevil]
+	- Ban reasons are read from the banfile now. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Revamped the way the ban list is handled internally. This allows an unlimited number of bans and fixes a memory leak. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added basic inventory drawing support to the Skulltag Doom HUD (doesn't respect scaling yet). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Revamped the way double defined actors are handled: If a definition of an already defined actor is encountered, "2" will be appended to the name and the new actor replaces to old one. This should give full compatibility with PWADs that use actors whose name conflict with Skulltag actors. [Torr Samaho]
+	- If a replaced weapon is added to a slot with setslot, the replacement weapon will also be added to the slot. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added MD2/DMD/MD3 model frame interpolation, controlled by the the new CVAR gl_interpolate_model_frames. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added model skin color translation support. The skin texture may only use colors from the game palette, otherwise it won't work properly. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Models respect the actor render style now, e.g. a model of a player with an invisibility sphere is rendered translucent. To reduce the problems caused by missing depth sorting, back face culling is used. This doesn't work if the model is not a closed surface. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added z-offset support to MODELDEF. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added flag ROTATING to MODELDEF. If this is set, the model constantly rotates like the weapon pickup models in Doomsday. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Made the model rotation customizable: [Torr Samaho]
		rotation-speed  float: Specify the speed of the rotation
		rotation-vector float float float: Specify the x, y and z component of the vector of the rotation
		rotation-center float float float: Specify the x, y and z coordinate of the center of the rotation
		(Defining rotation initializes the speed to 1, the vector to (0,1,0) and the center to (0,0,0))
+	- Added flag IGNORETRANSLATION to MODELDEF. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added workaround to smooth the model interpolation of actors that use the same frame twice in a row. Most of the standard Doom monsters do this in their see state. Can be activated by the new model flag INTERPOLATEDOUBLEDFRAMES. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added flag PITCHFROMMOMENTUM to MODELDEF. If this is set, the pitch of a model is estimated from the momentum of the corresponding actor. For example this can be used to render the models of rockets fired with a vertical angle different from zero properly. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added flag NOINTERPOLATION to MODELDEF. If this is set, the model frame interpolation is deactivated for this actor. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added DECORATE flags FORCEYBILLBOARD and FORCEXYBILLBOARD. If set, the selected billboard mode is enforced (overriding the gl_billboard_mode setting) when the sprite of the actor is drawn. This only affects the OpenGL renderer. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD getIP for server admins, which can be used to the IP address of a player. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added CCMD getIP_idx for server admins, uses indexes from playerinfo. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added CCMD ban_idx for server admins, to ban by index. [Rivecoder]
+	- When you run playerinfo from the server or RCON, player IPs (including port) are now displayed. [Rivecoder, Torr Samaho]
+	- The compact vote screen now obeys text scaling and displays nicely after voting. [Rivecoder]
+	- You can now see who voted for what on the scoreboard. [Rivecoder]
+	- On the scoreboard, multiple icons can be shown next to players (bot, talking, ready, handicap, vote). [Rivecoder]
+	- Crash logs can now be configured by the new CVAR crashlogs, which defaults to 1: [Torr Samaho]
		crashlogs == 0 : crash logs are turned off (not recommended)
		crashlogs == 1 : the standard crash dialog is shown
		crashlogs == 2 : the crash report is automatically written to disk using an unused filename of type CrashReportXXX.zip in the directory controlled by the new CVAR crashlog_dir (very useful for server admins)
+	- Added different particle drawing options to the GL renderer, controlled by the new CVAR gl_particles_style (default 2). [Torr Samaho]
		gl_particles_style == 0 : square (the way GZDoom renders particles)
		gl_particles_style == 1 : round
		gl_particles_style == 2 : smooth
+	- Added "give stdweapons" cheat that gives all weapons except for the Skulltag ones. Useful if you want to start a game in the middle of a Doom coop megawad for example. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added A_SpawnItemEx (ported the change from ZDoom revision 392+393+545 and made a few changes for the client/server architecture). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a "client side spawn" option to A_SpawnItemEx. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The "following" string is now drawn in that person's team color (if playing a teamgame). [Rivecoder]
+	- Added customizable gravity per actor (ported the change from ZDoom revision 456 and added necessary netcode). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added VSpeed DECORATE property so that an actor can be given an initial vertical speed (ported the change from ZDoom revision 373). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the possibility to build a server only binary that needs less depdendencies than the client. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Skins that the server does not have can now be seen by all players who have them. [Carnevil]
+	- Added disconnect scripts! They execute when a player leaves a game after being a non-spectating player. [Carnevil]
+	- The "showmedals" key can now we used while playing back demos. [Carnevil]
+	- Added the "stopdemo" command, which stops a client-side demo if one is playing. [Carnevil]
+	- Any weapons given by default to a player when he spawns (such as the railgun in instagib) can now be replaced via DECORATE. [Carnevil]
+	- Buckshot and instagib can now be set for campaigns. [Carnevil]
+	- The "Held by:" and "Scored by:" messages now display in one flag CTF. [Carnevil]
+	- Weapon flag NOLMS is now available in DECORATE. Weapons with this flag are not given to the player in LMS. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added whitelist support. IPs on this list are always considered not to be banned. This can be used to define exemptions from a range ban. The new CVAR sv_banexemptionfile specifies the filename of the list. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Code pointer A_CheckRailReload is now available via DECORATE. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Converted Minigun and Railgun to DECORATE. The DECORATE code of the Minigun was inspired by the STMinigun from tutnt.pk3. [Torr Samaho]

!	- Survival co-op is now disabled in hubs. [Carnevil]
!	- Skulltag's invasion spawners are now defined in skulltag.pk3. [Carnevil]
!	- Skulltag.wad is now loaded before doom2.wad. This should fix certain texture errors. [Carnevil]

!	- A proper error message is given when Skulltag is started with a shareware IWAD. [Torr Samaho]
!	- If a monster is killed in invasion, one monster corpse from the previous wave is removed (if there still is such a corpse). This should improve the speed on maps like ALINV11. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: sv_fastweapons is now clamped to values between 0 and 2. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: The server doesn't call P_Ticker anymore if there are no players. This significantly reduces CPU usage on maps with many monsters (of course only as long as there are no players). [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: If a player selects a new player class, the class will now be changed when respawning. So it's not necessary anymore to spectate and rejoin to change the class. NOTE: Players are still not allowed to change their class in single player or coop game modes offline. [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d-beta4
------------

*+	- Added Linux client and server support! [Torr Samaho]

+	- The crash dialog now works for servers as well! Now, if a Skulltag server crashes, it can be debugged and fixed! [Carnevil]
+	- Added new messages for Skulltag and Capture the Flag for returned and taken skulls/flags! [Rivecoder]

-	- Fixed the "Using unknown weapon type" bug, which happened in Ghouls vs Marines, if you are a Ghoul and fire your weapon after a map change. This should fix this bug once and for all (it occurred for Metal occasionally before) and could also fix the "player starts with fists" in coop bug. [Torr Samaho]

!	- Reorganized the Display Options menu; added the HUD menu. [Rivecoder]

+	- Added spread support rune for your custom DECORATE weapons! [Torr Samaho]

v0.97d-beta1
------------

*+	- ADDED GZDOOM RENDERING! Skulltag has switched renderers and we've dropped the slow and buggy ZDoomGL renderer. This entails fantastic support for ZDoom's features, blistering speed, and fewer bugs! [Torr Samaho!]
*+	- Added dynamic lighting for ALL items for the new renderer! These include Doom items and Skulltag ones. Torches now cast light, plasma shots let out an eeire glow, and the spheres pulse ominously. [Metalhead]
+	- Added name restrictions on all player names! Players can no longer create line breaks in the middle of their names, use invisible or strange characters, or use blank names! This should make vote kicking easier, and help stem name abuse. [Rivecoder]
+	- NEW minimal vote screen! A display option, the "Vote Now!" screen takes up a small area at the top of the screen, instead of the entire screen. This should make votes less painful. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added game-sensitive F1 help. What this does is changes the help screen to match whatever mode you're playing. If, for example, you are playing Possession, the help screen will show you how to play, etc. This can help new players learn the modes, as well as relieve experienced members from having to explain them. Ever had someone not know to score in Skulltag? "F1 DAMMIT!" [Rivecoder]
+	- Created a new mapinfo entry, "f1"! Mappers can create CUSTOM F1 screens that can explain their ACS mod or level! Each map can have its own screen. Hopefully this should become the standard place to explain your game mode. [Rivecoder]
+	- Voting can be fined tuned! Added these server cvars: sv_nokickvote, sv_nomapvote, sv_nochangemapvote, sv_nofraglimitvote, sv_notimelimitvote, _nowinlimitvote, sv_noduellimitvote and sv_nopointlimitvote. This way each vote type can be deactivated individually. [Torr Samaho]
+	- You can longer leave the map rotation with a vote. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Updated Skulltag's internals to use a hybrid of ZDoom 2.1.8 trunk and GZDoom 2.0.22 code. Not all of the new features (such as custom states) have been used yet. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added support for Terminator and Possession starts! TIDs 6000 and 6001, these allow mappers to choose where the Terminator ball and Hellstone spawn at the start of a level! If you don't use these starts, a deathmatch start will be used as normal. [Rivecoder]
+	- When a player leaves a server, in addition to his frags and wins, his playing time is saved. This means that if you reconnect, your time isn't reset. [Rivecoder]
+	- Added death frames for Ultimus! [Doomjedi]
-	- When you get the Doom or Guard sphere, your vision is properly rendered. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed Teleport to Map special online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a server crash when monsters left a level. [Torr Samaho]
-	- A player using a doom or guard sphere is rendered in the correct color for the other players. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Removed the 1 frame delay between when the BFG10K shot explodes and the damages is dealt. This fixes time freeze mode. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a crash where if you try to join a server, when having wads with the correct names, but which don't contain the map the server is running. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed bug where runes weren't stored when you saved the game. Wart 04 is playable now! [Rivecoder]
-	- Bots ignore additional events if their queue is full (since the queue fills easily in time freeze mode). This should fix the "Event queue size exceeded" bug. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Added a experimental hack to fix the decals of the super shotgun online. If this works properly, it will be used for all hitscan weapons. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed the give cheats online. [Torr Samaho]
+	- When a team scores in possession, the name of the scorer is also shown. [Rivecoder]
!	- Reorganized the player setup and multiplayer menu. [Rivecoder]
!	- Some internal changes how Actors are spawned online. I hope this can be used in the future to reduce the problems some have joining a server hosting UTNT. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Skulltag does not include most of GZDoom's gl-only features for now, such as 3D floors and reflective flats, to prevent advantages over software users.
!	- 0.97d briefly used ZDoomGL 0.81, but it caused more bugs than it helped. Major props to Torr for his hours of work to get both renderers working.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One remark about texture filtering: Because of countless complains in the past that the GL mode in general (regardless if ZDoomGL or GZDoom) is just too blurry and not doomish at all we decided to set the default filtering values in such a way, that the filtering resembles the software mode as closely as possible. These are not the recommended values, but the default ones, so that hopefully software renderer fans won't get scared away by the new renderer seconds after starting it for the first time.
The recommended values are as follows:

If you want to keep the sharpness of software more, but still enjoy filtering benefits, we recommend the settings

texture filter mode = none (mipmapped)
anisotropic filter = 16x

If you don't mind loosing a bit of the sharpness and want to enjoy all OpenGL benefits (as I do), we recommend

texture filter mode = trilinear
anisotropic filter = 16x

Especially if you use the high res textures, the latter is the way to go. Depending on the speed of your graphics card you can lower the anisotropic filter to improve performance.

v0.97c
------

+	- In invasion, ammo spawners now never run dry in network games.

*+	- Clients now have the ability to call a vote! Clients can now vote on whether or not to kick or ban a player, change the map, or change the limits (fraglimit, timelimit, etc.). Simply use the "callvote" console command, or use the "Call vote" command under the "Multiplayer" menu.
*+	- Added simple skulltag mode! You can now create a skulltag teamgame map by simply placing two skulls, team starts, and score pillars! NO SCRIPTING REQUIRED! More on how to set up the score pillars later (it's easy!).
*+	- Instead of being its own game mode, "instagib" is now a cvar that you can set to true or false and use with ANY OTHER GAME MODE! This means that you can how have instagib FFA matches, or instagib duels, or even instagib SKULLTAG!
*+	- Added the "buckshot" cvar! Similarly to instagib, when this is set to true, players start off with just the SSG, and no items spawn on the level, creating a SSG-only battle!
*+	- Made changes to almost all of the existing maps to improve their gameplay! Now, Skulltag's existing maps should be even better!
*+	- Completely rewrote the packet loss system! This fixes MANY of the glitches encountered during multiplayer play, such as ghosts, having a weapon but not being able to switch to it, etc.! This will also make existing games smoother!
*+	- Upgraded the ZDoom version to 2.1.7! Enjoy all the benefits that result from this, such as greatly advanced DECORATE support!
+	- Added the "text scaling" menu! This menu allows you to scale text to make it display as it would in ANY resolution! So, for all of you who use giant resolutions, now you can easily make the text readable, without making it TOO big!
+	- In cooperative games, players now spawn at a random cooperative starts if they don't have one themselves! This means that you can now have up to 32 man cooperative games, even if the map only has a single player start!
+	- Added cooperative backbacks! Backpacks containing all your items are now dropped whenever you die in cooperative mode! This can be disabled with the "compat_disablecooperativebackpacks" flag. (CURRENTLY DISABLED)

+	- The HUD now displays however many players are left standing in LMS mode!
+	- Added several new skins! These include "Nazi Guard", "Nazi Chaingunner", "Seenas" and "Synas"!
+	- The BFG10K has been almost completely redone! The weapon now charges before it fires, and has new graphics! It now also uses the same amount of ammo per shot in deathmatch and teamgames as in single player games.
+	- Improved the fullscreen HUD! Now it does a far better job of arranging things, and shows you what your max. health/armor is, and shows you if you're carrying the flag/skull in CTF/ST! If you wish, you can use the old fullscreen HUD by setting cl_stfullscreenhud to false.
+	- Added a new and improved medal display screen! Now, when you hit the "show medals" button, it shows you the number of medals you've earned in the current match in a much nicer fashion!
+	- Dramatically improved the display of various HUD elements in fullscreen (aka when the status bar doesn't display), such as the scores in CTF and ST!
+	- Added a way to configure the privliges of spectators during LMS games! Now, the server can set "lms_spectatorview" and "lms_spectatorchat" to true or false, to allow/disallow spectators to have the ability to view players or chat respectively while spectating during LMS games.
+	- Added the "First frag!" medal! This medal is awarded to the person who gets the first frag in a deathmatch game.
+	- Added the "Termination!" medal! This medal is awarded when you frag the terminator in terminator mode.

+	- Added the "Defense!" medal! This CTF/ST medal is awarded when you frag a flag carrier.
+	- Added the "Assist!" medal! This CTF/ST medal is awarded when you return your flag, prior to your team capturing the flag.
+	- Rewrote the announcer module, so that now CUSTOM announcer entries can be specified! The new entries can be played by specifying an object's pickup announcer entry in DECORATE.
+	- "Victory!" is now awarded for winning a LMS match, and "Perfect!" is now awarded for winning a LMS without losing any health.
+	- Added the ability to use wildcards in server bans! Bans such as 38.38.*.* are now possible.
+	- Added a new cvar, sv_flagreturntime! This sets the amount of time flags/skulls will return in after dropped. The default value is 15.
+	- Added tall versions of the Doom and Doom 2 skies! Thanks, EarthQuake (aka Seismos)! :)
+	- The map now resets to its original state at the start of each duel, and round of LMS.
+	- Added some new textures, featuring blood coming from a cacodemon's mouth, and also a Hell Knight splattered against a wall! Thanks, Baphomet!

+	- Added silver versions of all the red teleport flats.
+	- Text now displays and an announcer sound now plays when a flag or skull is dropped in CTF or skulltag mode.
+	- Added a new "nextmap" command! This is similar to "changemap", except ST advances to the next map, instead of the map specified. The next map is determined by the order in MAPINFO or the map rotation.
+	- Added a new linedef flags that only blocks PLAYERS! It is usable with the new Skulltag DB config file.
+	- Added a new menu option in the server console for managing LMS settings! This option can be used for configuring the allowed weapons in an LMS match, as well as setting the privliges for spectators (can they watch the game, talk to players in the game, etc.).
+	- Addded many, many new textures! Thanks, Nick Baker! :)
+	- You can now choose which powerups the random powerup item cycles through! For instance, you could have it only cycle between the doomsphere and guardsphere! More on this later.
+	- On the HUD during one flag CTF, players names now display entirely in their team's color, so you can tell which team possesses the white flag at a glance.
+	- When spectating through the eyes of another player, a message saying "FOLLOWING - <name of player>" is now displayed at the bottom of the screen.
+	- White flag pickup messages now indicate which team picked up the flag, instead of it merely saying "White flag taken!"
+	- Cameras now work in multiplayer games!
+	- Added death frames for the "Hissy Hogger" skin... eons after being relevant.
+	- Bots can no longer be added past the sv_maxclients limit in servers.
+	- Slightly improved the win sequence of normal deathmatch modes, and team games! Now, instead of exiting to intermission immediately, there's a slight pause where "<name of winner> WINS!" is displayed, similarly to duels and LMS.
+	- Added the "kickfromgame" command for server admins! Instead of kicking the player from the game, this simply removes them from the game by forcing them to spectate.
+	- Added a new "Auto-select" option that is now the default option when choosing a team in various team modes. This selects the most appropriate team for the player to join based on scores, number of players, etc. "Join random" now selects a purely random team.
+	- Added new decorative items: tall and small white torches, tall and small yellow torches, and tall and small red tech lamps!
+	- Made some minor cosmetic improvements to D2DM6 and D2DM7.
+	- Added a new cvar called sv_banfilereparsetime! This new cvar allows servers to periodically re-parse the banfile, with sv_banfilereparsetime being the time in seconds between parsings. This can be quite helpful when running multiple servers, since now if you ban someone, you don't have to manually add the ban on each server!
+	- Added a new cvar called r_maxparticles. This sets the maximum number of particles allowed on the screen. It default value is the same as the previous default value for max. particles, which is 4000. You can still load Skulltag with -numparticles to override this.
+	- Added unique sound lumps for grenades' launch and explosion. Now it's possible to make a new sound for rockets or grenades that do not affect one another.
+	- Increased the power of the prosperity rune! You can now pick up green armor past 100%, AND it raises both your max. health and max. armor to 250%!
+	- The sprites for the red armor have been completely redone, and greatly improved!
+	- The railgun color specified by your userinfo now applied to the inner railgun trail in teamgames (where the outer trail corresponds to your team color).

+	- Added a bunch of gory new decorations featuring the doomguy!
+	- Added more frames of animation to the flags, as well as improving their quality.
+	- Added a set of blue teleport flats.
+	- Added a display message and announcer sound for when the white flag is returned.
+	- When r_drawtrans is false, instead of players with the invisibility sphere being fully visible, their effect instead changes to that of the partial invisibility sphere.
+	- Skulltag now displays the ZDoom version along with its version in the lower left corner of the console.
+	- Improved the shading on the shoulder pads of the Base II skin.
+	- Added cleaned up versions of FLAT22 and FLAT24 (the red and blue jump pad flats). These don't have stray red/blue pixels around the edge.

-	- Weapons now give you give you the correct amount of ammo in teamgames.
-	- Fixed several flats that were either duplicates, or had names of existing textures. As a result, some flats have either been deleted or renamed. I apologize since I know this will screw up some (hopefully not a lot) existing wads, but I would be more than happy to update the wads.
-	- Your armor points now properly update whenever you're damaged in network games.
-	- Fixed bug where in terminator mode, the player's body was not flagged as being solid, allowing you to run through other solid objects.

-	- When a player is killed while possessing the terminator orb, the terminator orb is now properly removed from his possession (no more dead players with terminator icons above their head).

!	- The bots' chat files are now located within skulltag.pk3.

!	- blood_fade_scalar, which controls the blood fade brightness, now defaults to "0.5" (it used to be 1.0). Now, new players aren't blinded when they get hit by something.

!	- "Precision!" medals are now awarded for every 5 consecutive hits you make after receiving a "Precision!" medal. In previous versions, an "Accuracy!" medal would be awarded in this situation.
!	- The player who "You've taken the lead!", "You've lost the lead", etc. announcer events refers to is now the display player, not the console player.

v0.96f
------

*-	- FIXED THE INFINITE LOOP BUG! This means that not only do servers no longer lock up and eat all the CPU, but the "Abnormal number of movement commands" kick should not occur anymore as well (unless of course you're actually cheating!).
-	- Team scores that do not trigger the announcer are done appropriately in network games.
-	- Skins that are scaled now appear properly in the finale.

v0.96e
------

+	- Rewrote the "checksum" aspect of network games! It's now referred to as "level authentication". Now, level authentication is done prior to joining servers (so no more joining the game, and then immediately being kicked afterwards), and has a nicer error message.
*-	- Fixed the bug where clients would get kicked for "Abnormal level of movement commands detected!" if the CPU on the server machine was overloaded.
-	- Rewrote the ban system so that it no longer parses the ban file each time it checks to see if an IP is banned. This should eliminate the "Couldn't open banfile!" warning messages.

------

*+	- Upgraded the ZDoom version to 2.0.63a! That means that you can now create custom actors with the DECORATE lump! REJOICE!
*+	- Revamped the entire sector system in client/server games! Floors, plats, doors, etc. ought to sync up much better now. In addition, many new types of floors, plats, doors, etc. that didn't work before now do (such as perpetually moving floors).
+	- Made a number of small improvments to the "WAITING FOR PLAYERS" and "SPECTATING" displays.
+	- Added a new "Messages..." option in the menu of the server console! The window that comes up has options for timestampping, logging, and more! This is accessible through the "Settings" menu.
+	- Servers now minimize to the system tray! You can disable this if you'd like, by setting "sv_minimizetosystray" to "false".
+	- The server window caption now reflects sv_hostname, instead of always being "Skulltag v0.xxx Server". Now you should be able to distinguish between servers when alt+tabbing through them, and having them all pop up from the taskbar in Windows XP.
+	- Added new and improved Hectebus sprites! Thanks Agent Spork!
+	- Added the ability to configure which weapons you start with in LMS/TLMS! The weapons that you start with are now controlled by the variable "lmsallowedweapons", which can now be changed with the commands "lms_allowpistol false", "lms_allowshotgun true", etc.
+	- Added a nice new set of messages that display in the upper-portion of the screen whenever you frag someone, or are fragged in deathmatch games. Yet more stuff inspired by Quake 3! :) You can disable this in the "Display Options" menu if you wish to.
+	- Greatly improved the method of selecting maps when sv_randommaprotation is enabled! Now, maps are not repeated twice in a row, and there's much more randomization.
+	- Completed the "Server information" dialog box for servers.
+	- Added a new "Statistics" dialog box, selectable in the server menu! It shows you statistics for your server, such as the total data transferred, maximum number of players on the server at one time, etc.
+	- Updated the graphics on the SPREAD rune! It looks great now! Thanks, killingblair! :)
+	- Improved the team picking mechanism for whenever the server chooses a team for a player, and whenever a player selects to pick a random team.
+	- Improved the "Spectating" message that displays when you're spectating. Now, it displays more helpful messages, including your position in line, should be you be in line waiting to play!
+	- If everyone leaves a map when playing on a server, the map now restarts after 5 minutes.
+	- Bots can now use "$level_mapname" and "$level_levelname" in their chat strings to substiture the lump name of the map, and level name of the map respectively.

+	- Added a nice little display that shows the current weapon selected when cycling through weapons with the weapnext and weapprev commands. It can be disabled by setting "cl_showweapnameoncycle" to false.
+	- Rewrote a good portion of the scoreboard code. Players are now grouped together better (ex. all spectators are drawn next to each other, all dead players are drawn next to each other, etc.)
+	- Added a new "sv_disallowbots" option. When set to "true", this will prevent bot pathing nodes from being created, and also disallow bots from being used. This allows the memory usage of servers to go down drastically.
+	- The "Frags" column in the server console now changes to "Kills" in cooperative, and "Points" in teamgame modes.
+	- LMS matches can now end in a DRAW GAME! Now, if the last two players left standing die in the same frame, the match ends in a draw game, instead of the loser being whoever's death code was executed first!

+	- Added the ability for maps to disable to creation of bot nodes by specifying "nobotnodes" in the MAPINFO lump. This is to help large levels load faster. (Oh yeah, this also means bots won't work on those levels).

+	- Servers now ignore launcher queries from IPs that have been banned from the server.
+	- Hectebus fireballs now leave scorch marks.

-	- Fixed bug that allowed a sped up computer hack to cause players to move and shoot many times faster.
-	- All players are now hidden from view for spectators in LMS/TLMS games. Spectators are also no longer allowed to spynext in LMS/TLMS games. This prevents spectators from giving away locations, and other valuable information about players still in the game.
-	- Fixed the "You lost your body. Bad dehacked work is likely to blame." bug that would happen periodically in multiplayer games.
-	- The "consecutive deaths without a frag" counter is now reset at the beginning of each duel/LMS match. As a result, you can no longer receive "You Fail It" or YSINE medals after dying once, twice, or any amount lower than the required number of deaths for those medals.
-	- Fixed bug where if you changed teams, your old body remained solid (you could bounce grenades off it, etc.)
-	- Fixed bug where some items would always face east in network games, even if they had a different angle.
-	- Fixed bug where players who joined servers in the middle of a game would sometimes appear in-game on the scoreboard, when they were actually spectators.

-	- Spectators can no longer telefrag (however, this only had the potential to occur in single player games).
-	- Terrains that splash when you land on them (such as water) no longer create multiple splashes in multiplayer.
-	- Fixed D2DM7, so that you can no longer rocket jump "outside of the level".
-	- Then proper weapon now displays when spynexting your buddies when you are not a spectator.

-	- Fixed a problem where you couldn't toggle your "ready to go on" status during intermission in network games.
-	- Made a fix so that it should now be impossible to be kicked for userinfo flooding while connecting to a server.

-	- The level end delay is now reset if you change maps using the "map" command.
-	- Platforms that aren't activated by a line now work properly.
-	- The appropriate bullet puff type is set before enemies fire the railgun. This fixes a bug where if the enemy fired the railgun after the BFG10K would shot, all bullet of blood puffs would be BFG10K explosions.
-	- "Timelimit hit." now displays on the client end when time expires in a multiplayer game.
-	- Hidden skins are no longer displayed when the "skins" console command is used.
-	- You can no longer join LMS games during the win sequence.
-	- Removed the "droprune" command (it didn't do anything).
-	- Spectators are no longer factored into deciding whether or not your lead state has changed in a deathmatch game (ie. You can't take the lead against a player who's spectating).

-	- Fixed a small problem where a backslash ("\") at the end of a chat string would not show up properly.
-	- Banning a player with two words in his name now works properly from the "Kick/ban player..." menu item.

!	- Your view is now reset if you're spy's through the eyes of someone who becomes a spectator.
!	- Players are now sorted by fragcount on the scoreboard in team LMS.
!	- If a player gets another frag within two seconds of receiving an "Incredible!" medal, he now receives another "Incredible!" medal, instead of an "Excellent!" medal.
!	- The "Server information" dialog box is now accessible under the "Server" menu, instead of the "File" menu.

+	- You can now set the "chatfrequency" property of custom bots in BOTINFO lumps.

+	- You can now set compatflags in campaigns.
+	- Added a new skin, "Slyor"! This skin is based on Klesk from Q3A, and is now used by the bot Slyor. Thanks RottKing!
+	- Added new abilities when defining a new episode in MAPINFO lumps. Now, you can specify whether or not an episode is a bot episode, and what graphic/text to display atop the botskill menu. More on this later.

+	- Added a "Currently showing <x> servers" display message in the internal server browser window.
+	- Made a fix to a section of the client code that should result in less slowdown.
+	- Bots can now have their chat strings in wads! Several new botscript functions have been added to support this: SayFromLump, SayFromChatLump, ChatSectionExistsInLump, and ChatSectionExistsInChatLump. You can also specify "chatlump" for each bot in BOTINFO.
+	- You can now continue to see what place you're in during LMS games on the scoreboard after you've been killed.
+	- Added a new warning message for whever you try to specify a script lump or chat lump for bots that exceeds 8 characters.
+	- The "invalid checksum" error now has a better error message for clients who get kicked because of it.
*-	- Fixed bug that crashed servers whenever HudMessage was used within scripts. This prevented the D2ST1-3 from being played in multiplayer games.

*-	- Fixed the major slowdown problem with the bots on D2DM2.
-	- User info sent when a player is connecting to a server is no longer counted towards userinfo spam kick mechanism. This means that players who don't connect to servers quickly are no longer kicked. This hopefully fixes all of the player names left on the scoreboard problems, as well as an error causing the server to be full, when really it wasn't.
-	- Fixed problem where you could bounce grenades off some dead bodies in Last Man Standing.
-	- Fixed an exploit that allowed you to change visiblity to full brightness in single player, then connect to a server, retaining full visibility.

-	- Fixed problem where after an intermission during some sort of team-based skirmish, bots would constantly respawn.
-	- When creating no bots in BOTINFO lumps, if no chat frequency is specified, it defaults to 50 (percent). Before, the chat frequency was not initialized, and would often be some completely random. This is why custom bots would rarely (if ever) say their roaming strings, killed strings, etc.
-	- Winning/losing in campaign maps other than basic deathmatch modes now works properly.
-	- Servers now spawn clients with their proper handicap on their first spawn.
-	- The true position and angle of polyobjects that have been either rotated or moved now appear accurately for clients connecting to a server.
-	- Fixed problems where the handicap would have strange effects if it was set over 200 or less than 0.
-	- Player's true starting health is now displayed properly on the scoreboard. Before, it could display as less than 1, which isn't possible.
-	- Fixed all problems with the internal server browser. It should work fine now.
-	- Frags now display appropriately in the "Frags" column of the scoreboard in Team LMS.
-	- "Ready to go on" icons now work properly during the intermission of LMS and Team LMS games.
-	- Fixed a frame of the SS Nazi skin that had a pink spot on it. Thanks RottKing!

-	- Fixed problem where in multiplayer, sometimes players could run, but not have their body animate properly.
-	- You can now spynext/spyprev in teamplay deathmatch, Team LMS, team instagib, and cooperative mode, like you're meant to be able to.
-	- The botscript command CalcSpread() now works appropriately in team-based games.
-	- Ambient sound triggering now works properly in multiplayer games.
-	- Fixed a problem where a player could join a server and have wins, even if that player hadn't played on the server (the wins of a previous player weren't cleared).
-	- The titles of the botskill menus ("DEATHMATCH", "SKULL TAG", etc.) are now properly centered.
-	- Changing your weapon pickup preference at the weapon setup menu no longer can result in getting kicked from the server in network games.
-	- Fixed bug where particle fountains that were dormant to the server would appear to be active for clients connecting to that server.
-	- Made a small change to the bots' roaming function to eliminate an infinite loop that occured in extremely small maps. You can now play with bots in canthide.wad. Ugh.
-	- Scrolling through autoaim choices on the player setup menu during a network game no longer results in you getting kicked.
-	- Fixed strange display problem in the server console where two lines would display on one merged line.
-	- Fixed server console display glitch that would happen in strings that had two or more color codes in a row (ex. "say \cg\cgHI!").
-	- The "Champion is <name> with <x> wins" string on the server console scoreboard no longer looks odd if the player has colors in his name.
-	- Scrolling sectors now work in network games.
-	- The appropriate railgun color now used in Team LMS games.
-	- Eliminated "You cannot change deathmatch/teamgame during a campaign." messages when trying to start a new game through menus after playing a campaign.
-	- Spectators are no longer respawned when a match starts in LMS/TLMS.
-	- Fixed the SINMAP and ABRICK3 textures that somehow got renamed.
-	- Fixed a problem where players telefragged by their own team members at the beginning of a round in Team LMS couldn't respawn.
-	- Made a change to reduce, if not eliminate the occurance of no items spawning on a level when connecting to a server.
-	- Fixed problems relating to the number of duels that have been played on a map.
-	- Fixed bug where bots would rapidly open and close doors.
-	- The "Kick player..." and "Kick/ban player..." menus now works properly on the server console.
-	- Fixed bug where picking up the random powerup would display the pickup message to everyone, not just the person picking it up.
-	- Decals placed on a map now spawn for clients in a network game.
-	- Fixed problem in CTF network games where if a player was carrying a flag, the spectated, it spawned two flags on the client end (and one would remain as a ghost if the flag was returned).
-	- Spawning a bot with an invalid script name no longer results in the game crashing.
-	- Specifying new start maps for new episodes with the MAPINFO lump now works properly.
-	- Fixed bug where setting a fraglimit could cause strange problems with Team LMS.
-	- Fixed a problem with the last frame of the invisibility sphere animation.
-	- Fixed problem with the SS Nazi's front firing animation.
-	- "Intellect" is now spelled properly in use with BOTINFO and botscript functions. Setting the "intelect" property in BOTINFO lumps however still works for compatability.
-	- Fixed bug where people leaving LMS games could produce bizarre results, such as restarting the countdown.
-	- Botskill icons and players' handicap now show up on the scoreboard in team-based modes.
-	- Fixed problem where actors who were not players did not have their water level status updated to clients.
-	- Light_Fade and Light_Glow now work properly in network games.
-	- Your player rank in LMS is now determined by your number of wins, instead of your fragcount.
-	- Fixed a problem with a few flats used in D2CTF8 that was causing them to show up as a slightly different color.
-	- Fixed a number of minor texture misalignments on D2DM8. Thanks Assmaster :P
-	- Fixed a number of patches for textures that weren't showing up properly in Doom Builder's texture selection window.
-	- Abaddon no longer fight with Cacolanterns, and Belphegor no longer fight with Hell Knights.
-	- Removed the "RBAN1" texture, since ST already has a texture that has this. If a map used it, and this breaks it, I can put it back.
!	- The "Nightmare!" graphic on the botskill menu now uses a different graphic lump than the gameskill menu. The lump name is "M_BNMARE".
!	- Color codes are no longer used in logfiles. Now, lines with colors in them shouldn't cause logfiles to look strange.
!	- You can now change variables with the campaign lock flag during a campaign when sv_cheats is enabled.
!	- Removed the campaign lock from the "botskill" var. You can now change botskill mid-campaign.

------

v0.95g
------

*+	- Upgraded Skulltag to ZDoom version 2.0.53.
*+	- Made a massive fix to speed up item spawning on the server end. This results in much smoother, less laggy games. (Especially in levels with tons of objects. Co-op games should be MUCH better now.)
*+	- Made large optimizations to how sectors work over the network. They are now smoother and less laggy!
*+	- Applied "connection type" to ALL weapons. 56K users are simply told when a weapon is fired, and by who. DSL users are told that, and the actual XYZ, angle, and pitch of the shot, so they can recreate the shot on their end. Cable users get the information about each actual pellet or missile spawned by the weapon firing. The higher the connection type setting, the higher the precision, and the higher bandwidth used.
+	- Added sv_maxplayers, which limits the amount of active players in the game. People who join the game beyond this limit spawn as spectators.
+	- Added a trail effect for when players have the turbosphere or haste rune.
+	- Added field for the password that clients use to connect to passworded servers to the multiplayer menu.
+	- Added new compatibility flag that enables the original Doom sound curve.

+	- TakeInventory called by server-side scripts now shows up properly on the client end.
+	- Improved spying through other people's eyes while in spectator mode.
+	- Added "plasma bump bug" compatibility flag. When this is enabled, plasma bumping on MAP01, BFG bumping on dwango5.wad MAP01, etc. work "properly".
+	- Objects spawned by server-side scripts through Thing_Projectile now work.
+	- Added blue/red leads, teams are tied announcer events for teamplay DM mode.
+	- Added HUD display for team scores during teamplay DM mode.
+	- Added limited support for Heretic/Hexen weapons over the net.
+	- Item respawning has been moved more towards the server end. This removes item respawn problems under certain conditions (ie. item respawn in cooperative).
+	- While spectating, players' whos eyes you spy through, now display the proper view and weapon bobbing.
+	- Added "disable taunts" compatability flag. This is important because before, the silent BFG effect was triggerable by taunting.

-	- Fixed problem where if you were spying through the eyes of another player during coop, spectator mode, etc., and they disconnected, Skulltag would crash.
-	- Players now grunt and have their view height shift when hitting the ground hard on the client end.
-	- Fixed bugs where weapons appeared to be cleared between levels in co-op, but that really isn't the case.
-	- Fixed bug where spectators did not show up on the scoreboard in teamgame mode.
-	- Icons now spawn directly over the player instead of at their feet (with framerate uncapped, medals in pervious versions would "float" up to the top of the player).

-	- Fixed problem where enter scripts would only execute for one player.

-	- Monster pain chance is now no longer factored into the client end.
-	- Fixed telefrag bug where you appeared to be dead on the client end, but were still alive.
-	- Normal player sounds are now played when cl_skins is false. Before, even though the player sprite was normal, the sounds associated with the skin would still play.

(WARNING: This takes a LOT of bandwidth! Only do this if you're hardcore!)
!	- Slightly lowered the volume of the firing sound for the minigun.
!	- Railgun and BFG10K now produce decals.
!	- Missiles now spawn with the exact correctness of speed, position, and angle on the client end if both the server and client have at least a cable connection.
