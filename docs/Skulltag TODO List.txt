- Either adapt P_UseItems to the latest ZDoom changes or remove it. Currently it's just disabled.
- Make the old movement code compatible with the latest ZDoom code (P_OldXYMovement)
- Make the botpath code use the new ZDoom iterators instead of the old copies of P_BoxOnLineSide, P_BlockLinesIterator and P_BlockThingsIterator
